"""End-to-end grader validation against real Docker (canary, no LLM).

Hand-crafted patches with known correct verdicts, asserting grade_patch
agrees. Every assertion is a deterministic oracle (compiler / ASAN exit code);
re-attack is unit-tested separately with mocks since it needs an LLM in the
loop.

Skipped if Docker can't spawn containers (set VULN_PIPELINE_DOCKER_RUNTIME=runsc
on hosts where the default runtime is unavailable).
