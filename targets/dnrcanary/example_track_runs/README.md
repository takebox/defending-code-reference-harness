# dnrcanary — example /dnr-hunt → /dnr-respond run

This directory holds a captured run of the detection-and-response tracks
(`/dnr-hunt` followed by `/dnr-respond`) against the `dnrcanary` target with
its log corpus generated at `--seed 42`. It's checked in so you can see what
"good" output looks like — the structure of `INCIDENTS.json`, how the
hypothesis ledger reads in `INCIDENT_REPORT.md`, and what a proposed response
plan covers — without burning tokens on a full hunt yourself.

> **SPOILER WARNING.** These files reveal the planted attack campaign in
> full — attacker IPs, the vulnerable routes, the credential that was
> cracked, and the exact PoCs. If you want to try `/dnr-hunt` on dnrcanary
> yourself, **do not read past this point** until you've run it. The
> exercise is the hunt, not the answer.

## Reproducing this run

```bash
# 1. Generate the log corpus (deterministic per seed; ~82 MB, gitignored)
python3 targets/dnrcanary/generate_logs.py --seed 42

# 2. Run the hunt — no alert in hand, baseline → hypothesis → confirm → detonate
/dnr-hunt targets/dnrcanary

# 3. Work the first incident into a response plan
/dnr-respond INC-1
```

The tracks write into `results/dnrcanary/<timestamp>/`; the files below were
copied from that run directory.

## Artifacts

| Artifact | Produced by | What to look at |
|---|---|---|
| `INCIDENTS.json` | `/dnr-hunt` (then enriched by `/dnr-respond`) | Two `confirmed_exploited` incidents with verdict, attacker IPs, `vuln` (file/function/line), evidence pipelines, verified PoCs, and quantified `blast_radius`. Four `ruled_out` entries showing how alert noise and benign top-talkers were dispositioned. |
| `INCIDENT_REPORT.md` | `/dnr-hunt` | The human-readable hunt report: executive summary, unified campaign timeline, per-incident source confirmation + PoC transcript, and the full **hypothesis ledger** appendix — every query that was run and what it ruled in or out. |
| `RESPONSE-INC-1.md` | `/dnr-respond INC-1` | The proposed (never executed) response plan for the SQLi incident: containment / eradication / recovery / detection-engineering tables, each action carrying *what / why / risk-if-wrong*. |

## Not included

- `targets/dnrcanary/logs/` — the 82 MB corpus is gitignored; regenerate
  with `generate_logs.py --seed 42`.
- `ground_truth.yaml`, `grade.py` — these are graders, not track outputs.
  Run `python3 targets/dnrcanary/grade.py <run_dir>/INCIDENTS.json` yourself
  to self-score.
