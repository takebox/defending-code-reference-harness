"""Score an INCIDENTS.json against dnrcanary's ground truth.

Usage:

    python3 targets/dnrcanary/grade.py INCIDENTS.json [--json]

Expected INCIDENTS.json shape (extra fields welcome — checks match on
content, not structure):

    {
      "target": "dnrcanary",
      "incidents": [
        {
          "id": "INC-1",
          "title": "SQL injection in /search exploited to dump users table",
          "verdict": "confirmed_exploited",
          "attacker_ips": ["..."],
          "vuln": {"type": "sqli", "route": "/search",
                   "file": "app/app.py", "function": "search"},
          "impact": "...",
          "evidence": ["access.log: ...", "app.log: ..."],
          "poc": {"command": "curl ...", "verified": true}
        }
      ],
      "ruled_out": [
        {"subject": "...", "verdict": "attempted_not_vulnerable",
         "reason": "..."}
      ]
    }

Verdict vocabulary: `confirmed_exploited` and `suspected` for entries in
`incidents`; `attempted_not_vulnerable` and `benign` for entries in
`ruled_out`. Negative findings go in `ruled_out` — saying what you ruled
out, and why, is part of the job. Splitting the campaign into more
incidents (e.g. a separate account-takeover entry) is fine; checks accept
any matching incident.

Scoring is deterministic, local substring matching — no LLM, no network.
It is an honor-system self-score: it cannot tell a real hunt from a
write-up assembled around the answers. Execution-level verification
(re-firing PoCs in a fresh container) belongs to the autonomous track's
grader, not this script. This file and ground_truth.yaml are spoilers;
don't open them mid-hunt.
