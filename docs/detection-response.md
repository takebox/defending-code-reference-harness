# Detection & response

Everything else in this repo is preventive: find the vulnerability before an
attacker does. The detection & response track assumes prevention failed and
an **attacker is already in the logs**. This track helps you find them,
scope the damage, and respond. Many of the same principles apply: evidence
over plausibility and verification over vibes. But they're applied to
telemetry instead of source code. Looking for the static source scan?
That's the [`/vuln-scan` track](../.haijun/tracks/vuln-scan/TRACK.md).

The track ships as two tracks: `/dnr-hunt` and `/dnr-respond`. They can be
used in combination with the other tracks as follows:

```
/dnr-hunt  →  /dnr-respond  →  /triage  →  /patch
(find it)     (scope + plan)   (verify)    (fix)
```

`/dnr-hunt` is the no-alert entry — sweep the corpus for anything that
shouldn't be there, and generate alerts.
`/dnr-respond` is your starting point when you have a lead: an alert,
an IOC, or a hunt finding goes in; a verdict, a quantified blast radius, and
a proposed response plan come out.

See [best-practices.md#detection-and-response](best-practices.md#detection-and-response)
for the DNR best practices these tracks implement.


## The demo target: dnrcanary

The demo target is `targets/dnrcanary/`: a deliberately vulnerable Flask
storefront plus one week of web logs containing a planted attack campaign,
benign traffic, and a noisy dead end. The logs are **generated locally and
gitignored** — nothing to hunt ships in the repo, and generating them is
the required first step before any track run. The corpus is large by
design: big enough that the agent must query it rather than read it, which
is closer to what hunting real logs feels like.

How to run the tracks and the outputs to expect is captured in their
READMEs: [`dnr-hunt`](../.haijun/tracks/dnr-hunt/README.md) (no alert in
hand) and [`dnr-respond`](../.haijun/tracks/dnr-respond/README.md) (lead
in hand). The scenario you're dropped into, and the corpus's determinism
guarantees, are in
[`targets/dnrcanary/README.md`](../targets/dnrcanary/README.md).

Each track writes to a per-run directory, `results/<target>/<timestamp>/`,
and prints the path — `INCIDENTS.json`, the incident report, and the
response plan all land there, so a re-run never clobbers a prior one.
`/triage` and `/patch` write to the directory they're invoked from — run
them from inside the run directory to keep the whole chain in one place.

The target ships its own answer key (`ground_truth.yaml`), a deterministic
grader, and a generator whose source encodes the campaign. The target README
marks all three as spoilers — keep them out of the hunt and *run* them only
(generate, then grade). Grading is your move after the write-up, which is
also exactly how you should run seeded exercises against your own
environment. In the interactive demo this is operator discipline; the
autonomous harness enforces it structurally — the hunt container is built
without the answer-key files.

## The autonomous mirror: dnr-pipeline

The same exercise runs unattended, mirroring how `vuln-pipeline` mirrors
the interactive scanning tracks:

```bash
python3 targets/dnrcanary/generate_logs.py --seed 42    # still required first
bin/vp-sandboxed dnr-pipeline run targets/dnrcanary --model <model-id> [--runs N --parallel]
```

One run = two sandboxed containers. The **hunt agent** gets the app source
(baked into its container image) and the log corpus mounted read-only — and nothing else from the target:
the answer key, the grader, and the log generator never enter its
container, by image construction. It hunts under the same hard rules as
`/dnr-hunt` (query-don't-read, ledger, PoC-gated verdicts) and submits an
`INCIDENTS.json`. The **grade agent** runs in a fresh container with the
answer key and deterministic scorer mounted read-only; only the submission
crosses the boundary. It scores the write-up, then independently re-fires
every confirmed incident's PoC against a freshly seeded app — substring
checks can be gamed, execution cannot. Results land in
`results/<target>/<timestamp>/` with streaming transcripts and a
`result.json` per run.

Like vuln-pipeline, agent-spawning commands refuse to start outside the
gVisor sandbox unless `--dangerously-no-sandbox` is passed, and the model
is always a runtime argument (`--model` / `VULN_PIPELINE_MODEL`).

## Customizing for your environment

- **Your own logs.** Point `/dnr-hunt` at any directory of access, app,
  or auth logs (`/dnr-hunt /var/log/myapp --repo ~/src/myapp`). The method
  is format-agnostic; Phase 0 identifies formats and field positions
  before anything else runs.
- **Other telemetry sources.** CDN/WAF exports, auth provider logs, and
  EDR/endpoint threat events drop into the same loop — export to
  CSV/JSONL, hunt the files. For endpoint telemetry you pivot on process,
  host, and user instead of IP, session, and route. The verdict ladder is
  unchanged either way: telemetry alone never confirms; configuration or
  binary review plus a controlled reproduction does.
- **Your own seeded exercise.** The highest-leverage customization:
  rebuild dnrcanary's shape on your stack. Stand up a disposable copy of
  one of your services, plant a known weakness, run a scripted attack,
  capture real telemetry, write the ground truth, and make the same
  tracks hunt it. That artifact becomes your team's calibration loop and
  onboarding exercise.
- **Detection engineering as the follow-on.** Every confirmed incident in
  `RESPONSE.md` ends with proposed detection rules derived from the
  queries that actually found it. Feeding those back into your alerting
  is how the hunt compounds instead of repeating.

## Scope and limits

- The demo app and all its data are synthetic; the app binds to
  `127.0.0.1` and must never be deployed or exposed.
- The tracks never send traffic to remote hosts and never execute response
  actions. The demo target's spoiler files (ground truth, grader,
  log-generator source) are marked in its README and stay unread by
  convention in the interactive demo — a deny-list can't make that a hard
  guarantee, so none is attempted. The autonomous harness enforces the
  separation structurally: the hunt container is built without the
  answer-key files.
- The tracks' `allowed-tools` lists shape permission prompts and intent, not
  security. `Bash(python3:*)` is effectively arbitrary execution, so the
  curated list is not a sandbox — the real confinement for autonomous runs is
  the harness's container isolation, and for interactive runs it is the
  permission prompts.
- Log-only detection is hard; treat the demo as a method to practice, not
  a guarantee of recall on arbitrary corpora. Seeded exercises (the
  seed-ground-truth practice in
  [best-practices.md#detection-and-response](best-practices.md#detection-and-response))
  are how you measure recall on *your* telemetry.
