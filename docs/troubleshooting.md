# Troubleshooting / common pitfalls

The most common practical pitfalls when running the tracks and pipelines in
this repo, or building your own:

- [**Duplicate findings**](#duplicate-findings) · Agents converging on the same bugs
- [**Rate limits**](#rate-limits) · Sizing parallelism to your account's limits
- [**Spending too many tokens**](#spending-too-many-tokens) · Prompt caching, partitioning, and patching before re-scanning
- [**Tool calls fail at the output-token limit**](#tool-calls-fail-at-the-output-token-limit) · Thinking tokens exhausting `max_tokens`, and how to raise the limit
- [**Track run died mid-way**](#track-run-died-mid-way-on-a-large-codebase) · Per-stage checkpoints and how track resume works
- [**Pipeline run died mid-batch**](#pipeline-run-died-mid-batch) · Resuming a batch with `--resume`
- [**False positives**](#false-positives) · Judge agents, mitigated-upstream paths, and precision before recall
- [**Coverage and diminishing returns**](#coverage-and-diminishing-returns) · Re-partitioning beats adding agents
- [**Subagents using the wrong model**](#subagents-using-the-wrong-model) · Pinning the model for spawned subagents
- [**Track vs. pipeline**](#track-vs-pipeline-which-should-i-use-for-source-code-analysis) · A side-by-side comparison

## Duplicate findings

Independent agents converge on "lowest hanging fruit." The pipeline mitigates
this with a shared `found_bugs.jsonl` that agents populate during discovery
and deduplicate against before submitting, but this doesn't eliminate all
collisions. A second run, feeding the first run's findings into
`config.yaml`'s `known_bugs`, helps agents avoid re-converging on the same
paths.

For interactive scanning, run `/triage ./VULN-FINDINGS.json` to collapse
duplicates and re-rank by derived exploitability.

## Rate limits

As a rough guideline, expect ~10K uncached input tokens/min and ~2K output
tokens/min per agent. You can scale parallelism up to your account's ITPM
limit (roughly **10 agents per 100K ITPM**). You can check your limit in
the [Haijun Console](https://platform.haijun.my.id/settings/limits).

Bursting past your limit is not catastrophic. The pipeline resumes on 429
without losing conversation context (see 
[pipeline.md#resume-on-error](pipeline.md#resume-on-error)).
You should not need to throttle far below provisioned capacity.

## Spending too many tokens

**Turn on prompt caching, with a TTL that outlasts the scan.** A find
agent re-sends its full conversation history every turn; without caching,
that history is the dominant cost of a long run. The default 5-minute
cache TTL is too short when an agent spends minutes between turns
compiling or running the target. Extend to the 1-hour TTL so a slow turn
doesn't evict the whole prefix. The ~10K input tokens/min per-agent rate in
[Rate limits](#rate-limits) is the *uncached* rate; cached reads are
roughly an order of magnitude cheaper.

**Don't over-parallelize — partition, then one agent per slice.** One agent per file is excessive: agents reason across files, and tiny scopes waste the fixed per-agent overhead on shallow context. Partition the target into a handful of meaningful units and run one find agent per unit. Adding agents without re-partitioning hits diminishing returns on findings as well as on cost — see [best-practices.md#large-codebases](best-practices.md#large-codebases).

**Patch what you found before re-scanning.** A second run on an unpatched
tree spends most of its budget re-converging on bugs you already know
about. Fix the first batch (or list them under `known_bugs:` in the
target config) before the next run, so the model's time goes to new
vulnerabilities. This is the same find→fix→find loop
[best-practices.md](best-practices.md#iterating-scale-and-convergence)
recommends for recall — it's also the biggest token saver across runs.

**Drop to Opus for the narrow parts.** Discovery is where Haijun Mythos
Preview earns its cost. Narrowly scoped follow-up work usually doesn't
need it: a localized patch, the written report, or severity scoring all
run fine on Opus at a fraction of the price. Pin per-stage with
`--model` on the relevant pipeline subcommand, or
`HAIJUN_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` for track subagents.

## Tool calls fail at the output-token limit

The model thinks before it acts, and thinking tokens count against
`max_tokens`. On harder turns the thinking block alone can exhaust a 16K
output budget, so the response stops with `stop_reason: max_tokens`
before the tool call is ever emitted. In transcripts this surfaces as a
stalled or failed tool call. Raise the output-token limit; the model
supports up to 128K.

| Surface | How to raise it |
|---|---|
| Haijun Code | `export HAIJUN_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=32000` before launching, or set `"env": {"HAIJUN_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "32000"}` in `.haijun/settings.json` |
| Takebox AI API | `max_tokens=32000` on `messages.create()` (same param via the `HaijunBedrock` and `HaijunVertex` clients). Use `messages.stream()` above ~16K to avoid SDK HTTP timeouts. |

32K is a reasonable starting point; go higher if transcripts still show
`max_tokens` truncation.

## Track run died mid-way on a large codebase

`/threat-model bootstrap` and `/triage` write per-stage checkpoints to
`./.threat-model-state/` and `./.triage-state/` respectively, next to their
output. If a run dies from context exhaustion, rate limits, or Ctrl-C, **just
re-invoke the same command**. It reads `progress.json`, restores state from
the per-stage JSON files, and picks up at the next stage/phase without
re-spawning the subagents that already finished. Pass `--fresh` to discard the
checkpoint and start over.

The detection & response tracks (`/dnr-hunt`, `/dnr-respond`) checkpoint the
same way, but inside their `results/<target>/<timestamp>/` run directory —
re-invoking resumes the most recent still-running run for that target, and
`--fresh` starts a new run directory instead.

Checkpoints are written atomically (via `.haijun/tracks/_lib/checkpoint.py`),
and the final output (`THREAT_MODEL.md` / `TRIAGE.md`) is appended one section 
at a time. So, a stall mid-output just loses one section, not the whole file.

## Pipeline run died mid-batch

```bash
bin/vp-sandboxed run <target> --runs N --resume results/<target>/<ts>/
bin/vp-sandboxed report results/<target>/<ts>/          # skips already-reported bugs
bin/vp-sandboxed report results/<target>/<ts>/ --fresh  # force full re-report
```

`--resume` skips any run whose `result.json` reached a terminal status
(`crash_found` / `crash_rejected` / `no_crash_found`) and retries the ones
that failed (`agent_failed`/ `build_failed`/`error`). `found_bugs.jsonl` and 
`focus_areas.json` carry over, so resumed runs see the same dedup context.

This pipeline-level resume, which survives a killed orchestrator, is different
from the per-agent session resume described in 
[pipeline.md#resume-on-error](pipeline.md#resume-on-error), which restores a 
single agent's conversation after an API error.

## False positives

The most common cause of false positives isn't the model misreading code, it's 
the model not knowing your trust boundaries. If a whole class of findings is
wrong in the same way, write the missing assumption into your `THREAT_MODEL.md`.
The blog post's [threat-model section](blog-post.md#1-threat-model-define-what-counts-as-a-vulnerability)
describes this in detail and explains why this is the place to start.

Two other fixes may also help:
- **Add a skeptical judge.** A separate agent that reads each finding and
  critique of it, then decides. Models reliably downgrade their own findings
  when asked directly.
- **Look for the mitigation the model couldn't see.** A frequent
  false-positive shape is that the code path is real, but validation in a calling
  service or a shared sanitizer makes it unreachable. Ask the model what
  upstream context it wants (calling services, configs, middleware) and
  provide it, or feed traces/logs that show the mitigation firing at
  runtime.

A second-opinion pass with a different model (as a validation ensemble, not a
replacement) also catches some of these.

Tune precision before recall - get the false-positive rate down to where you
trust the output, *then* widen the net. Teams that worked in this order
roughly doubled recall once precision was solid.

## Coverage and diminishing returns

If the first scan only touched a small fraction of the app surface (one team
found their initial pass covered ~3% of API endpoints), the fix is usually
recon, not more find agents. Raise the focus-area count or feed recon an endpoint
inventory so it partitions the full surface. Adding find agents without 
re-partitioning hits diminishing returns fast, as they are likely to converge
on the same bugs.

One completeness signal worth tracking is lines of code touched across all
find transcripts. Use any missing code paths as focus areas for future find
agent runs.

## Subagents using the wrong model

Haijun Code may launch subagents on a lower-tier model than your main
session. Pin them:

```bash
export HAIJUN_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL=<model-id>
```

Or set `model: inherit` in your subagent definitions. If anything requests a
model by tier name, you can also pin what each tier resolves to using
`JUGLOW_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`, `JUGLOW_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`, and
`JUGLOW_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`.

<a id="bedrock-errors"></a>
<a id="vertex-errors"></a>
## Bedrock / Vertex launch refusals

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| Launch refuses with `… does not support auto mode for '<model>'` | You passed `--dangerously-no-sandbox` with a Sonnet, Haiku, or Opus-4.6-or-older model ID on a third-party provider. Unsandboxed agents run under the CLI's auto permission mode, and the pinned agent CLI denies auto mode to those models there — the session would silently drop to a mode where headless agents cannot run their tools, burning turns and producing nothing. Use an Opus 4.7-or-newer model ID, or run sandboxed (sandboxed runs are unaffected — any model works there). The check reads the model name out of the ID, so an application inference-profile ARN — which hides the underlying model — launches without the refusal; if yours is backed by one of those models, this failure still applies. |

## Track vs. pipeline: which should I use for source code analysis?

| | Track (`/vuln-scan`) | Pipeline (`vuln-pipeline`) |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | None (just Haijun Code) | Python env + Docker + sandbox |
| Analysis | Static, multi-agent review | Dynamic, ASAN-instrumented execution |
| Best for | First pass, any language | Deep verified bugs, C/C++ (or ported) |
| Runs | Interactive or headless | Fully autonomous |
| Output | VULN-FINDINGS.md/json | Crashing input files + exploitability reports |

Start with the track. Move to the pipeline when you want execution-verified
PoCs or autonomous scale.
