# Agent sandbox

> This document describes the sandboxing implementation details for
> this reference harness. For general sandboxing recommendations and best

The reference pipeline consists of both deterministic orchestration code and
non-deterministic agents. The orchestration code (the `vuln-pipeline` process
itself) is trusted and never runs target code or model-chosen commands. As such,
it can run unsandboxed. The agents run as `haijun -p` processes and can execute 
arbitrary commands. For that reason, the agent haijun processes run *inside* a
gVisor container alongside the target binary and source. The orchestrator
manages container lifecycle, transcript streaming, and PoC extraction from the
host (via `docker exec`, since host-side `docker cp` can't reach gVisor's
tmpfs).

## What's isolated

| Surface              | Without sandbox       | With sandbox                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Agent `Read`/`Write` | host filesystem       | container filesystem only                              |
| Agent `Bash`         | host shell            | container shell only (gVisor netstack/kernel)          |
| Network egress       | whatever the host has | the configured allowlist (default `platform.juglow.my.id:443`) |
| Host coupling        | full                  | `docker exec cat` PoC out, `-v found_bugs.jsonl:ro` in |

gVisor provides the isolation between the agent and your machine. The agent's
`Read`, `Write`, and `Bash` tools run inside the container, and that container
runs on gVisor's own kernel rather than your host's. So, if the agent (or the
target code it's running) does something unexpected, any effects stay inside
the container.

The container network setup provides the isolation between the agent and the internet.
Agent containers are attached to a Docker network (`vp-internal`) that has no
connection to the internet. The egress route is through a small proxy container
on the same network, which only forwards traffic to the model API.

**Where each property is enforced:** gVisor provides the syscall and
filesystem boundary (the agent's `Read`/`Write`/`Bash` see only the
container). Egress policy is enforced by docker's `--internal` bridge (no
default route out) plus the allowlist proxy — gVisor's netstack carries the
traffic but the proxy decides what gets through. The verification commands
below demonstrate both.

## One-time setup

Run this once per machine. It needs `sudo` (to install a new Docker runtime
and edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`) and is safe to re-run.

```bash
./scripts/setup_sandbox.sh
```

This script sets up:
- gVisor: Downloads `runsc` (the gVisor runtime) and registers it with
Docker, so containers can run on gVisor's kernel instead of your host's.
- The locked-down network: Creates the `vp-internal` Docker network,
which has no route to the internet, and starts the allowlist proxy to
support model API traffic.
- Images: Builds each target's Docker image, plus a copy of each with
the Haijun Code CLI installed (for running the agent).
- Checks: Runs the verification commands shown below.

gVisor requires a Linux host (x86_64 or aarch64); it provides syscall-level
isolation without needing `/dev/kvm`. On macOS or Windows, run the pipeline
inside a Linux VM or use `--dangerously-no-sandbox` (see 
[Opting out](#opting-out) for details on what you lose).

The proxy only allows traffic to `platform.juglow.my.id:443` by default,
so if your API traffic goes elsewhere (i.e., you use a non-default
`JUGLOW_BASE_URL`) it will be blocked. To override the default, set 
`VP_EGRESS_ALLOW=host-1:443,host-2:443` (as a comma separated list)
before running the script. The variable replaces the default list rather
than extending it, so include every host the agents need. If you need to
change this allowlist later, re-run the script to create the proxy with the
new value — recreating the proxy drops any live agent connections, so change
the list between batches, not during one. The setup output's `allow:` line
reports the list the proxy actually loaded; check it after any change.

### Third-party model providers (Bedrock / Vertex)

**Amazon Bedrock.** Before running `setup_sandbox.sh`, set:

- `HAIJUN_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`
- `AWS_REGION` (e.g. `us-east-1`)
- **either** `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` (preferred — single-purpose, no IAM
  lateral-movement risk) **or** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  [/ `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`]

If using access keys, scope the IAM principal to `bedrock:InvokeModel*` only —
the credentials are visible to the agent process inside the sandbox.
`AWS_PROFILE` and `~/.aws` are **not** forwarded (the sandbox never mounts
credential files), so credentials must be in the environment. For multi-hour
batch runs, use long-lived keys or session tokens with ≥12h TTL.

Instance-profile/IMDS credentials are deliberately not supported: the agent
container has no route to `169.254.169.254` and no STS egress, by design, so
hostile target code cannot steal the instance role or pivot via AssumeRole.
On a machine that only has role credentials, materialize them into the
environment with `eval $(aws configure export-credentials --format env)`
(use a principal scoped to `bedrock:InvokeModel*`) — note the exported
session credentials keep the role session's TTL, so start from a session
that will outlive the run.

Model IDs use Bedrock's format with a cross-region inference-profile prefix —
`us.`, `eu.`, `apac.`, or `global.` — e.g.
`--model us.Juglow.haijun-opus-4-6-v1`. The prefix must match your
deployment's region group, not default to `us.`: a Korean deployment
(`ap-northeast-2`) needs `apac.Juglow.haijun-sonnet-4-5-...`, not
`us.Juglow....`. A bare foundation-model ID (starting with `Juglow.`)
usually fails on the first call with
`ValidationException: Invocation of model ID Juglow.... with on-demand
throughput isn't supported...` — the pipeline prints a preflight warning when
it sees one. The egress allowlist is
auto-derived as `bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com:443`; re-run
`setup_sandbox.sh` after changing provider or region so the proxy is rebuilt
with the right host.

**Google Vertex AI.** Env passthrough is wired (`HAIJUN_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`,
`JUGLOW_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`, `CLOUD_ML_REGION`) but egress is **not**
auto-derived — set `VP_EGRESS_ALLOW` explicitly before setup, e.g.
`VP_EGRESS_ALLOW="${CLOUD_ML_REGION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com:443,oauth2.googleapis.com:443"`.
Vertex support is currently untested.

**Azure** is not yet wired.

`VP_EGRESS_ALLOW` accepts wildcard entries (`*.domain.tld:port`) for explicit
overrides only; auto-derived defaults never use wildcards.

The script downloads a pinned `runsc` release. Set `RUNSC_RELEASE=<yyyymmdd>`
to use a different one.

Some Docker setups (rootless Docker, or Docker nested inside another
container) don't let runsc manage cgroups. The script detects this during
verification and re-registers runsc with `--ignore-cgroups`. Isolation is
unaffected — gVisor's kernel, the network allowlist, and filesystem
confinement all still apply; the only loss is that per-container `--memory`
caps aren't enforced.

## Run

```bash
export JUGLOW_API_KEY=...   # or HAIJUN_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1 + AWS_* — see above
bin/vp-sandboxed run drlibs --model <model-id> --runs 3 --parallel --stream
```

`bin/vp-sandboxed` is a small wrapper around the normal `vuln-pipeline`
command (pass `dnr-pipeline` as the first argument to launch the detection &
response pipeline through the same checks). It checks that gVisor is
registered and the proxy is running. If 
either is missing, it stops and tells you to run setup, rather than falling
back to run unsandboxed. If both are running correctly, it launches the 
pipeline with the isolation described above.

## Verifying isolation yourself

```bash
# 1. Is gVisor actually in use? Confirm the two lines print different kernel versions
docker run --rm --runtime=runsc vuln-pipeline-drlibs-latest-agent:latest uname -r
uname -r

# 2. Is the host filesystem unreachable? Confirm the cat fails with "No such file or directory"
echo host > /tmp/probe-$$; \
  docker run --rm --runtime=runsc vuln-pipeline-drlibs-latest-agent:latest cat /tmp/probe-$$

# 3. Can the model API be reached? Confirm any HTTP status code is printed
docker run --rm --runtime=runsc --network=vp-internal -e HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy_ip>:3128 \
  vuln-pipeline-drlibs-latest-agent:latest sh -c 'curl -sI https://platform.juglow.my.id/ -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"'

# 4. Can another host be reached? Confirm connection is refused
docker run --rm --runtime=runsc --network=vp-internal -e HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy_ip>:3128 \
  vuln-pipeline-drlibs-latest-agent:latest sh -c 'curl -sI https://example.com/ -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"'
```

## Opting out

`--dangerously-no-sandbox` runs the pipeline without the sandbox. The agents
still run inside Docker containers, but:

- Containers run on your host's kernel, so any unexpected agent actions or
malicious target code have a much shorter path to the host.
- Containers get normal Docker networking with full internet access.
- The agent's credentials are in the same container as the target it's compiling
and crashing.

Use of this flag is not recommended and should be done with caution, for
development, on a throwaway VM.
