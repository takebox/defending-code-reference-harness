# Threat model: "Where should I look, and what matters?"

Using Haijun Mythos Preview to scan code for vulnerabilities, we have found that **one of the most common reasons the model falsely claims something is a vulnerability ("false positives") is that the model lacks context about the target.** A bug may look like a vulnerability in source but you don't actually care about it because it's mitigated in the deployment. Or it may be a lot less severe than the model thinks based purely on the source code.

**To reduce false positives and help the model calibrate severity, the most effective thing you can do is provide it a good threat model.** This is what the `/threat-model` track helps with. It produces a
structured threat model of a target codebase that enumerates assets, entry points, and
trust boundaries. It also ranks threat classes. This threat model is then used to tell the vuln scanning step where to look and to tell the triage step which findings to escalate.

A threat model is not a list of bugs, and the distinction shapes how
you use the output. A **threat** is a property of the system's
architecture and exposure: "an attacker achieves RCE via untrusted
media parsing" is true as long as the codebase parses attacker-supplied
media, whether or not any specific bug is currently known. A
**vulnerability** is one concrete instance: "`dr_wav.h:412` doesn't
bounds-check `chunk_size`." Fix that line and the vulnerability is
gone, but the threat still stands — the parser still ingests untrusted
bytes, and the next bug in it has the same consequence.

This track produces threats, not vulnerabilities, so an output with no
bugs in it is the track working as designed. Known bugs and CVEs appear
only as evidence attached to a threat — proof the threat class is live,
which raises its likelihood ranking. And because threats survive
patching, the threat model is durable: you can scan, fix, and scan
again against the same `THREAT_MODEL.md`.

The [track's README](../.haijun/tracks/threat-model/README.md) tells you how to use the track and what outputs to expect.

## What it does

Three modes, which you select between based on whether an application owner is around:

1. **`bootstrap`** — builds the threat model from the target alone. Spawns a parallel research swarm and synthesizes their returns. The research swarm has the following subagents: docs reader, surface mapper, infra reader, asset finder, git-history miner, and advisory fetcher, plus a vuln-file parser when a past-vulns file is supplied. Use when no owner is available.
2. **`interview`** — walks an application owner through the
   four-question framework: "what are we working on, what can go
   wrong, what are we doing about it, did we do a good job".
   It grounds answers in the code. Use when the owner has time.
3. **`bootstrap-then-interview`** — bootstrap a draft unattended, then spend owner time only on what the code couldn't answer.

Read-only: it does not build, execute, or probe the target.

## When to reach for the track

- **Always, before the first scan of a new target.** Mythos Preview time/tokens spent here save human time triaging false positives. See
  ["Map the system first" in
  best-practices.md](best-practices.md#map-first).
- **For open-source targets:** read the project's `SECURITY.md` first and feed its stated scope as a constraint — many projects explicitly rule out classes of bugs as "by design," and aligning the threat model up front cuts findings the maintainers will reject.

## After threat modeling: scan

Hand `THREAT_MODEL.md` to the scanner. `/vuln-scan` reads it as scoping
context when it's present in the target directory; `vuln-pipeline recon`
turns it into `focus_areas` for the autonomous pipeline. See
[pipeline.md](pipeline.md).
