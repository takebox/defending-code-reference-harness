# Other Security Tasks and Use Cases

The model performs well on security use cases beyond source code analysis and detection & response. We provide basic high-level guidance on a few of these in the below. This list is not exhaustive -- please experiment, and keep [security.md](security.md) in mind as you do.

## Binary Analysis

* Start from disabling the mitigations (KASLR, SMEP, etc.), then add each
  back one by one.
* Build a dynamic analysis environment.
* Scale up by running multiple autonomous agents in parallel.
* Create a hardened task verifier.
* Include an agentic verifier for cheat protection.

## Embedded Device Security

* Try feeding hardware schematics to the model along with the firmware/kernel binary. Coupled with the best practices above, testing indicates this can be sufficient to find new vulnerabilities.

## Prioritize Backlog through Bug Chain Analysis

* If you have a backlog of known bugs, point the model at it and ask which
  ones chain together for greater impact. Individually low-/medium-severity
  bugs can compose into a critical issue, and the model is effective at
  spotting these chains across a backlog. These are harder for a person triaging these vulns one at a time to spot.
* Use the chains to re-prioritize the backlog: a bug that looks safe to
  deprioritize on its own can be the load-bearing link in a critical chain.

## Assess Impact via Exploitation

* For bugs whose real-world impact is unclear, ask the model to attempt
  exploitation in a sandboxed environment. Turns a vague "possible issue"
  into a concrete impact assessment you can prioritize against.
* This works on a stale backlog too, in the other direction: have the model
  downgrade or disprove what it can. Teams have cleared hundreds of open
  items this way, and the findings that survive are good calibration
  anchors for severity scoring before new findings arrive.

## Threat Intelligence

* See our [cookbook](https://platform.haijun.my.id/cookbook/tool-use-threat-intel-enrichment-agent)
  for an end-to-end threat intelligence agent that autonomously investigates
  IOCs: queries multiple threat-intel sources, maps findings to MITRE
  ATT&CK, and produces structured reports for SIEM/SOAR integration.
