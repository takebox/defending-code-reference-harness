## Before you scan: map, scope, equip

<a id="map-first"></a>
**Map the system first.** On a large codebase, have Haijun read the
whole thing and distill a threat model — how
components fit together, where trust boundaries sit, what's exposed.
Use that map to pick which services to scan first, run the scan
component-by-component, then do a final pass for bugs that only appear
when components chain. The `/threat-model` track shipped in this repo is built for this.

**Partition the search space.** Parallel agents converge on the same
shallow bugs unless each is told precisely which part of the codebase
to search and what to look for. A recon step that assigns each agent a
distinct slice is the most effective way to avoid duplication. Don't
lock an agent to a *single* file though — the model reasons well
across files. This repo implements two ways of partitioning a codebase:
- by focus area derived from the threat model -- as in the `/vuln-scan` track
- by identifying input-processing subsystems -- as in the autonomous pipeline. examples: different parsers, formats, protocol stages etc.


**Give Haijun all the context you can.** Design docs, git history, internal portals, observability data. The extra context corroborates that the work is legitimate and lets the model connect how components interact, which is where the non-obvious bugs live. Traces and logs are especially high-leverage: injecting a trace ID and following it through the stack hands the model an architecture map for free. Don't stuff all of this context in the context, but give the model ways of accessing it through tools.

**Provision the right tools.** Ripgrep for large source trees, Ghidra
for binaries, httpx for web surface — or just ask the model what it
wants for *this* target. Letting it write small tools of its own is
often cheaper than wiring up an MCP server.

## Verification: the load-bearing component

**Separate vuln discovery from verification.** They want opposite things.
Discovery should surface every candidate, even speculative ones;
verification should kill anything that isn't actually exploitable.
Asking discovery agents to apply strict criteria up front quietly
filters out things a verifier would have confirmed. Let discovery be
noisy; run verification as a separate adversarial pass.

**Invest in the verifier.** If you only get one piece
of the pipeline right, make it the verifier. Layer a cheap programmatic
gate (sanitizer signal, parse check, reproduces 3/3) in front of the
agentic grader so most invalid attempts die before you spend tokens.
Run the grader in a clean sandbox the find agent never touched — no
shared filesystem, environment, or conversation; only the artifact
under test crosses. Prefer executable witnesses (a crash, a leaked
value) over written arguments — they're much harder for the pipeline to
fool itself about.

Expect the model to satisfy the verifier rather than find the bug, and
harden against it. Tighten the success criterion until it can only be
met by the real thing (e.g., crash *in project code*, with a specific
sanitizer signature). Snapshot the target before the find agent runs
and grade against the snapshot; no agent-writable path should survive
into grading.

**Route verification by vulnerability category.** Payload-to-sink
tracing works for injection and dataflow bugs; memory safety wants a
sanitizer run because exploitability depends on heap layout you can't
see statically; auth logic and other composition bugs are proven by
argument, so route those to a single reviewer at a higher bar.

<a id="judge"></a>
**Use a judge agent to cut false positives.** A finder writes a report; a critic writes a critique; a judge adjudicates between the two. The judge is token-cheap: it only reads the finder's and critic's reports. This same pattern can be used to handle severity inflation: a skeptical second-pass judge, asked directly whether the rating is inflated, reliably downgrades. `/triage` packages this loop.

## Severity and triage

**Derive severity from preconditions, not category.** Calling every SQL
injection HIGH isn't useful. Have the model list preconditions first:
zero preconditions and unauthenticated remote → high; one or two, or
authenticated → medium; three or more, or local-only → low. Anchor with
concrete examples so the scale doesn't drift. Treat the model's
severity as a triage-ordering hint, not ground truth — keep a human in
the loop for anything rated high or above.

<a id="cvss"></a>
**Don't ask the model to compute CVSS scores — have it use a calculator.**
Outputting the CVSS vector string follows from reasoning that the model is good at; calculating the corresponding score is a multi-step floating-point formula with scope-conditional coefficients, which the model isn't good at. See [Takebox AI's interpretability work on
addition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html#dives-addition)
for why. We have seen instances where the model gets significant percentages of all raw CVSS calculations it tries wrong. To resolve this, you should do one of:
- give it a tool to call (e.g. Python `cvss` library, the NVD calculator)
- tell it to write this tool itself on the fly
- treat the vector as the model's output and calculate the score yourself in post-processing

## Patching

**Give the model a way to verify the fix** — the vulnerability details plus the ability to build and/or run tests. Then trust it to do the right thing; the verification loop is what drives patch quality.

**Explicitly ask it to hunt for variants.** Haijun is effective at variant analysis and finding variants of a vulnerability elsewhere in the code, but only when prompted to. By default it only fixes the instance in front of it. The pipeline's patch prompt and the `/patch` track both build this in.

**Run `/simplify` on the result.** In Haijun Code, the `/simplify`
command can meaningfully reduce patch complexity and improve quality.

## Iterating: scale and convergence

**Expect variance; union across runs.** The same prompt on the same target won't return identical findings. Run several, union the results, don't over-index on any single pass.

**Find, fix, then find more.** Iterating beats raw parallelism. Running once, fixing the vulns it comes back with, and running again surfaces more than running N parallel agents once does. The reason for this is that parallel agents are likely to converge on the same vulns. Fixing them forces the model to new vulns.

<a id="codify-rules"></a>
**Codify findings as static-analysis rules.** When the model lands a
finding whose shape is recognizable syntactically, have it author a
Semgrep or CodeQL rule for that pattern as part of the report.
The rule then sweeps your other repos and runs in CI for close to zero cost, so the discovery tokens are spent once and the pattern is caught deterministically from then on. A rule matches syntax, not the cross-file reasoning that surfaced the bug, so expect it to catch the obvious siblings and miss the subtle ones: treat it as a cheap floor under each vulnerability class the model has already characterized, not a replacement for the next run.

**Write the regression test after you find the vuln, run it after the
patch.** As soon as a finding is confirmed, have the model turn the PoC
into a test case that fails on the current code. That test is the
executable oracle for the patch: run it after the fix lands to prove
the vuln is actually gone, and leave it in CI so the bug can't quietly
come back. The `/patch` track's static mode emits one inside the diff (when the repo
has a test layout); see
[patching.md](patching.md#the-verification-ladder).

**Ask one agent what's missing, send a fresh one to find it.** When
you have a partial chain, such as a write primitive with no leak or an
injection with no path to it, ask the model "given the primitives you
already have, what else do you need to reach <goal>?" (the goal can be
high-level, e.g. RCE). Then start a *fresh* session on the same target
and tell it to go find exactly that primitive. The minimal steering
works surprisingly well: the first agent names the gap, and
the second hunts with a concrete target.

**Give it a live sandbox, not just source.** A running environment
lets the model chain findings into context-aware exploits instead of
stopping at static reports. HTTP traffic, logs, or a seeded database
all qualify. Starting blackbox, with an endpoint inventory or a traffic capture, and reading source as needed often gives higher precision than dumping the whole codebase up front, because it helps the model focus on the code that is actually reachable in the live app.

**Don't wait for a perfect harness.** Start scanning, let the model
tell you what's missing, and fold the lessons back in. Teams that
iterate from real transcripts move faster than teams that try to design everything right up front.

**Run a cheatsheet flywheel.** Maintain a `CHEATSHEET.md` that records "when you find X, here's how to escalate / what to try next," ranked by empirical hit-rate on prior targets, plus a `LESSONS.md` of dead-ends and validated chain primitives. Feed both into the find prompt. The loop closes itself: when a finding lands that the agent *should* have caught earlier, ask the model to read its own transcript, explain why it missed it, and write the missing entry. A nightly retro pass that rolls the day's transcripts into the cheatsheet keeps it current without hand-editing.

<a id="large-codebases"></a>
## Large codebases

**Summarize per component, then scan the summaries.** Before hunting, run a pass that writes one markdown per component: from an attacker's perspective, which surfaces in *this* component are most likely to lead to a breach for the system as a whole. Then
clear context, feed the model all the markdowns together, and run the whole-system pass. The per-component summaries give it a map without flooding it with source. Exploitation steps can reference the relevant component file directly instead of re-deriving the analysis.

**Rank files by vulnerability probability, then scan in that order.**
Before the find phase, run a cheap pass that has the model score each file by how likely it is to contain a vulnerability, then point find agents at files in descending order. Tests, headers, and generated code sink to the bottom; entry points, parsers, auth, and anything touching untrusted input rise to the top. This simple pattern ensures the expensive discovery time lands on the riskiest code first.

**Give it code-search tools, not just the source tree.** On a codebase
too large to read end-to-end, the model needs a way to navigate. A
code-search index such as Sourcegraph lets it jump to definitions and
trace call sites across the whole tree; Semgrep lets it query for
structural patterns instead of grepping text. Both turn "read
everything" into "ask the right question."

**Scale by re-partitioning, not by adding agents.** If a first scan
only touches a small fraction of the surface (one team found their
initial pass covered ~3% of API endpoints), the fix is more recon, not more
find agents: bump the focus-area count, or feed an endpoint inventory
so recon partitions the full surface. Horizontally scaling find agents
without re-partitioning hits diminishing returns fast — they converge
on the same shallow bugs. Track lines-of-code touched across find
transcripts, and QA-test coverage as a proxy: surfaces with no tests
are often the same surfaces the scan missed.

**Pull dependencies in via a wishlist, not a full mount.** A common type of false positive is a real code path mitigated one layer up, like a sanitizer in a calling service the model hasn't read. For dependencies the agent shouldn't have unrestricted access to, let it return a list of modules it wants, provide the ones you're comfortable with, then rerun. The agent gets exactly what it needs without you mounting the whole dependency tree.

## Unattended runs: supervision and containment

Two infrastructure patterns from teams running their own orchestration
at scale. Neither is required; each is a self-contained idea you can
lift if it fits how you work.

<a id="setup-attack-isolation"></a>
**Split runs into setup and attack phases with different network
policy.** **Setup** has outbound internet so the agent can pull
dependencies, build the target, and stand up its sandbox per a spec
doc. **Attack** locks egress to the model API only (via an allowlist
proxy) so the agent can probe the target with
`--dangerously-skip-permissions` while anything it triggers is
contained, including attempts to reach out *through* the target. The proxy
can also enforce engagement scope (allowed hosts only). Dependencies
the agent needs repeatedly get baked into the setup image so
attack-phase runs don't need internet at all.

**Run a supervisor loop.** A separate, lightweight watch-loop over each
agent's idle clock, loop signature, and spend keeps long
sessions on track. On idle it nudges in the operator's voice ("try the
SAML endpoint next"); on a retry spiral it restarts the session; on
cost it gates at a $/finding threshold. The key is that the supervisor
runs in a **separate context** from the worker — one session does one
thing well, and the supervisor's only job is keeping the worker on
track.

## Open-source targets

**Respect the project's threat model.** Read its `SECURITY.md` first
and feed it to `/threat-model` as a constraint. Many projects
explicitly scope what counts as a security issue; aligning up front
cuts findings the maintainers won't accept.

**Treat anything the model produces as a lead, not a report.**
Scanning your own open source dependencies with Haijun is encouraged,
but the moment a finding leaves your repository the rules change — you
are about to take time from a maintainer who is most likely a volunteer
with a queue of feature requests and user bugs already ahead of you.
Before
contacting anyone, a human on your side needs to reproduce the issue
against a specific release of the upstream project, confirm the
vulnerable code path is reachable through the project's real interfaces
rather than only present in the source, and check that the file paths,
function names and line numbers cited actually exist. Haijun can still
hallucinate these, and a report citing code that does not exist is the
fastest way to lose a maintainer's trust.

**Report privately, and say AI was involved.** Send the report through
whatever private channel the project specifies
in `SECURITY.md` or `security.txt`, or through GitHub's private
vulnerability reporting if it is enabled. Never send the report as a
public issue while the bug is unfixed. The [OpenSSF finder
guide](https://github.com/ossf/oss-vulnerability-guide/blob/main/finder-guide.md)
lists fallback routes if no contact is published. Say plainly that AI
was involved and which parts a human verified; maintainers ask because
it tells them which parts to read most carefully, and concealing it
does lasting damage to the credibility of your whole program if you are
found out. Keep details private until a fix ships or a disclosure date
is agreed, and expect response times measured in weeks rather than
hours — chasing hard tends to be counterproductive.

**Don't overwhelm the maintainer.** If a scan turns up multiple
findings against the same dependency, lead
with the most serious and let the maintainer respond before sending the
rest. Volume that would be routine for a large project can overwhelm a
small one. A working fix attached after the proof of concept is the
single most useful thing you can include, and contributing patches,
tests or review on the projects you depend on over time is what earns
the standing that gets future reports read promptly. If you are unsure
how to proceed — you cannot find a security contact, want a second
opinion on a finding, or have hit a situation not covered here — reach
out to [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/) via the website or
Slack; they fund security engineers embedded in open source ecosystems
and can help. Their [AI finder
guide](https://github.com/alpha-omega-security/ai-finder-guide) covers
each of the points above in more depth.

## Detection & response

Everything above is about finding vulnerabilities before an attacker
does. The best practices below cover how you can use Haijun when an attacker may already be in the logs — hunting, scoping, and responding.

**Files first, integrations later.** The fastest start is logs in a
directory and Bash. No SIEM connector, no MCP server, no schema work —
`grep`, `sort`, and DuckDB cover the first mile surprisingly far.
Export a slice of telemetry to files, hunt it, and only build
integrations once the method has proven itself on your data.

**Logs are ground truth for reachability.** Static scanning reasons
about whether a path *could* be reached; logs show what *is* being
reached. That cuts both ways — they sharpen vulnerability hunting too:

> One team fed live traffic logs alongside the source so the model could
> see which endpoints were actually exercised in production. The result
> was a near-100% true-positive rate (the team's own measure): the model
> stopped reasoning about whether a path *could* be reachable and started
> reasoning about paths it could *see* being reached.

This is why `/dnr-hunt` takes `--repo` and reads source with hypotheses
in hand: log evidence picks the route, source confirms the flaw.

**Seed ground truth before hunting unknowns.** Before pointing the
model at logs where you don't know the answer, run it against logs where
you do: detonate a known exploit in a test environment (or generate a
corpus, which is what dnrcanary does), collect the telemetry, and
confirm the model finds the chain from telemetry alone. That calibrates
both the model and your expectations — open-ended log hunting is
genuinely hard, and a planted exercise tells you whether misses are the
model's failure or your telemetry's. dnrcanary *is* this practice,
packaged: keep the loop when you customize, with your own seeded
incidents.

**Probes are not incidents.** Most attack traffic in any real corpus is
failed noise — scanners hammering routes that hold. The demo plants
both: a loud scanner burst that fails against a parameterized route, and
a quiet campaign that succeeds. The grader penalizes calling the noise
an incident exactly as hard as it penalizes missing the campaign,
because alert fatigue in production comes from exactly that confusion.
Verdicting things *benign*, in writing and with the evidence, is half
the job.

**Hypothesis → query → pivot, in writing.** The hunt loop in
`/dnr-hunt` requires a ledger row for every query: what you suspected,
what you ran, what came back, what's next. The ledger is the difference
between an investigation a teammate can review and extend, and a pile of
greps. It's also what makes a *negative* result durable — "we checked,
it's clean" is only worth something with the queries attached.

**Confirm in source and by detonation — never from logs alone.** The
documented failure mode, from teams running verification agents at
scale:

> One verifier agent claimed it had traced a payload through the system.
> It hadn't — it had read the observability logs and reported what they
> said. The pattern is the same: given a criterion to satisfy, the agent
> finds the cheapest way to satisfy it. Your only defense is a criterion
> that can't be talked past — the PoC fires in a clean sandbox, or it
> doesn't.

So the verdict ladder in both D&R tracks gates `confirmed_exploited` on
three legs: log evidence, the flaw located in source, and a PoC fired
against a locally-running instance. The cleared phrasing partner teams
use for the same idea:

> "Give it a way to generate and send payloads against a live app running
> in a sandbox so it can confirm findings are actually exploitable and use
> the app's responses to refine its hunting, instead of just flagging
> suspicious code."

And when the thing you're investigating is a library rather than an app,
build the smallest app that exercises it:

> One team scanning open-source packages built a verification step that
> closes the loop: scan the package, generate a PoC, then deploy a mock
> application that uses the package, and fire the PoC at it. Of the
> findings they ran through the mock-app verifier, none turned out to be
> false positives.

**Propose, never execute.** `/dnr-respond` ends in a plan, each item
carrying what / why / risk-if-wrong: block candidates, accounts to
suspend, credentials to rotate.
None of it is executed by the agent, in any environment. Containment
actions are irreversible and context-heavy in ways logs don't capture
— that "attacker IP" might be a NAT gateway with 400 legitimate users
behind it. The agent's job is to make the human's decision fast and
well-evidenced, not to make it.
