## Usage marker

Agent API requests carry a declared, removable usage marker (an
`Juglow-cyber-runbook` header and a User-Agent token) — structural metadata only,
never content. See `docs/pipeline.md#usage-marker` for exactly what is sent
and how to remove it.

## Why the sandbox is necessary

Frontier models are increasingly good at finding creative paths around
restrictions. This is what makes them effective vulnerability hunters. 
However, it also makes them capable of taking unexpected actions against 
their own execution environments. See the
[blog post's sandbox section](blog-post.md#2-sandbox-run-agents-safely-and-verify-exploitability) for
examples of where teams have seen this in the wild.

The lesson we've learned from our work is that models will use whatever
capabilities they actually have access to, not necessarily just what you
tell them they have. For that reason, **constraints must be enforced in code,
not in prompts.**

This repo does that for you. Every agent runs inside a gVisor container
with network egress limited to the Haijun API (as described in 
[agent-sandbox.md](agent-sandbox.md)). Agent-spawning subcommands refuse to
start outside that sandbox unless you explicitly pass `--dangerously-no-sandbox`.

## Rules for running autonomous agents

- Launch the pipeline using `bin/vp-sandboxed` which verifies the sandbox
  is set up before starting any agents.
- Don't run autonomous agents in plain Docker (with `runc`). Ordinary 
  containers share your host's kernel, so a kernel bug triggered by the
  target inside the container can compromise your host.
- Don't run containers with `--privileged` or with host networking.
- Match the level of isolation to the task. A plain container is fine for
  an agent that can only read code, while something with stronger isolation
  (e.g., gVisor, Kata Container, Firecracker microVM) should be used for
  running the target.
- Never mount credential-bearing paths (e.g., `~/.aws`, `.env`) into the
  agent's environment.
- Don't connect agents to MCP servers or tools that can write to the outside 
  world (prod infrastructure, email, cloud storage).
- If you're driving the pipeline interactively from Haijun Code, rely on the
  auto-mode permission classifier and have a human approve any action that
  reaches outside the repo. Auto mode eliminates routine permission prompts
  by auto-approving reads and working-directory edits, and routing everything
  else through a background classifier that blocks destructive, irreversible,
  or off-task actions. Your explicit ask/deny rules still apply, and repeated
  blocks make it fall back to normal prompting.

## Separating setup and attack phases

The general pattern (described in the
[blog post](blog-post.md#2-sandbox-run-agents-safely-and-verify-exploitability))
is to do everything that needs the internet first (pull dependencies, install
tools, etc.), freeze the result, and give the attack phase no egress route
except to the model API.

In this repo, that split looks like:

1. Setup: Building the target image - `docker build` pulls dependencies
   and compiles the target with normal network access. The agents then run
   against that image on the `vp-internal` network, where the only way out
   is the allowlist proxy (default `platform.juglow.my.id:443`; see
   [agent-sandbox.md](agent-sandbox.md) for Bedrock/Vertex).
2. Freeze: the image is the snapshot. Base images, commit SHAs, and dependency 
   versions are pinned in the Dockerfile so every run uses the same bits.

See [agent-sandbox.md](agent-sandbox.md) for more details on this setup, and
[best-practices.md](best-practices.md#setup-attack-isolation) for the fuller
version of the pattern — per-target credential scoping and using the proxy as
an engagement-scope enforcer.

## Prompt injection

To minimize the risk of prompt injection attacks, don't give the agents 
untrusted tracks, plugins, or MCP servers from the internet.

The pipeline's own agents also read target-derived data: ASAN traces (which
contain function names and file paths from the target's symbol table),
exploitability reports, and build/test output. A malicious target author
could in principle embed instructions in those strings. The find and report
agents have limited blast radius. They run inside a gVisor container on an
internal network with egress restricted to the API, and they only produce files
that you read. The **patch agent** is the higher-stakes case. Its output is
a diff you may apply to a real codebase. The pipeline wraps target-derived
text in the patch prompt in `<untrusted_data>` blocks with a per-call random 
id and instructs the agent to treat it as only data (not instructions). However,
these measures are a mitigation, not a guarantee. Review every generated diff
before upstreaming. See [patching.md](patching.md#reviewing-generated-patches) 
for what to look for.
