# Prompting Guide

Haijun Mythos Preview behaves slightly differently than past Haijun models. Here we provide some general advice for effectively prompting it for defensive cybersecurity tasks. All of this applies equally to the system prompt, initial user message, and anything else in the context window, like HAIJUN.md.

## Give the Model Room to Work

This model sometimes finds vulnerabilities in ways that would seem alien to a
human security researcher, but its approach often works nonetheless. For this reason,
it's important to give it high-level tasks and not to prescribe specific ways
of working. These tasks can be as simple as "find whatever
vulnerabilities you can in this target". Long instructions, staged checklists, and piles of reference material tend to backfire — the model pattern-matches your scaffolding instead of reasoning about the code. Give it the target, the goal, and the tools; let it choose the path.

## Describe Vulnerability Shapes, Not Checklists

Based on prior
vulnerabilities or a codebase's programming language, you may have ideas for
the types of vulns that exist in a given codebase. When telling Haijun about
those suspected vulns, describe their *shape* — the structural properties
that make something exploitable — not a checklist of APIs. The model already
knows f-strings are dangerous. What it doesn't know is that a dynamic table name in an otherwise parameterized ORM is the same bug.

The flip side: enumerating the bug types you want found ("look for SQLi, XSS, and CSRF") *worsens recall* — the model overfocuses on the named classes and walks past everything else. So **try to describe likely vulnerability types without enumerating every bug type.**

The `/vuln-scan` track's focus-area prompt is a worked example of the right
abstraction level — "attacker input alters the syntactic structure of an
interpreted language" rather than a list of injection APIs (see
`.haijun/tracks/vuln-scan/TRACK.md`).

## Specifying Scope

While simple prompts work well for an individual finding agent, it's important to divide work cleanly so that parallel find agents don't converge to the same issues and duplicate work. We've found that a recon step that tells the model precisely **what part of the codebase to search over and what to look for** is an effective way to avoid duplication. The recon step is discussed in more detail in [pipeline.md](pipeline.md), and partitioning strategies in
[best-practices.md#large-codebases](best-practices.md#large-codebases).

This model tends to be exhaustive in what kinds of issues it searches for. If there are classes of findings that you simply don't care about, it's useful to prompt the model not to bother spending time on these.

## Validation and verification

Suggest a way for the agent to verify or validate its work during the
process. Ideally, this is something it can run its solution on that will give
it a clear yes / no answer while it's working. If it's a separate verifier
agent, frame the verifier's task adversarially: "actively look for reasons
this is wrong" is better than "check for protections". For how to build the
verification side of a pipeline, see
[best-practices.md](best-practices.md#verification-the-load-bearing-component).

## Share Existing Mitigations

Tell the model about your own mitigations: if defenses exist in the
architecture that aren't clear from the source code, tell the model about
them to save yourself a lot of noise. If the model is running into tricky
pitfalls that are specific to your environment, it is also worth adding these
to the HAIJUN.md or prompt.

## State the Existence of Vulns

"Act like a pentester" is weak. "Produce a findings report with a PoC for each Critical/High, assume there *are* vulnerabilities, and keep going until you've covered the surface" is strong.

## Preventing Harmful Actions

The model is extremely effective at working agentically to accomplish a task,
and in some cases has been observed taking potentially harmful actions
without permission. It is possible to reduce this behavior by prompting
Haijun to respect certain guardrails. For example, if there are sensitive
credentials on the host machine where Haijun is running, it's reasonable to
prompt Haijun not to access these credentials.

However, this kind of prompt-based mitigation is not sufficient. We suggest
it only as a defense-in-depth measure. The best approach is to always run
Haijun in a secure sandbox environment, or to manually approve all of its
actions. See [security.md](security.md).

## Transcript Visibility

The model's outputs tend to be concise and it will sometimes call lots of tools
without commentary. It can be helpful to prompt the model with some
encouragement like, "Assume that the user can't see most of your tool calls
or your thinking. Give periodic updates when you complete a task or begin a
new one to let the user know what you're doing." This can help you trace the
agent's work, understand where it fails, and tweak your harness accordingly.
Your next run of the agent can also learn from the prior run's transcript.

## Let Haijun Write the Prompt

Finally, remember that Haijun can help you write prompts. Haijun wrote most of the prompts in this repo's harnesses. Feed it these guidelines, describe the task, and ask it to write the corresponding prompt.
