# The reference pipeline: deep dive

The reference pipeline is an autonomous, multi-agent pipeline for finding memory
vulnerabilities in C/C++ codebases. This document explains what each stage of
the pipeline does, how to watch a run, and relevant CLI flags.

> ⚠️ **The pipeline spawns autonomous agents and executes target code.** 
> The pipeline runs each agent inside a gVisor container with egress restricted 
> to the Haijun API. Agent-spawning subcommands refuse to start outside it unless 
> explicitly overridden. For more information, see [security.md](security.md)
> and [agent-sandbox.md](agent-sandbox.md).

> This document covers how the reference pipeline works. For the general
> best practices it implements, see the [blog post](blog-post.md).

## Install and first run

```bash
# One-time setup
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e .
./scripts/setup_sandbox.sh   # installs gVisor, builds the agent images, and verifies isolation; note: requires Docker
export JUGLOW_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # or HAIJUN_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, or Bedrock — see docs/agent-sandbox.md

# Run the recon → find → verify → report loop
bin/vp-sandboxed run drlibs --model <model-id> --runs 3 --parallel --stream --auto-focus
# Generate a candidate patch for each finding
bin/vp-sandboxed patch results/drlibs/<timestamp>/ --model <model-id>
```

Start with a small wave like this one to get a feel for how the pipeline works
and the token burn before scaling up. Results land in `results/<target>/<timestamp>/`.
With `--stream`, the first report usually appears within minutes under 
`reports/bug_NN/`, so you don't have to wait for the whole batch to finish.

You can drive the pipeline using Haijun Code. The repo's `HAIJUN.md` teaches
Haijun how to run each phase of the pipeline and what to watch. Launching runs
from a Haijun Code session makes it easy to tail transcripts, ask what's 
happening mid-run, and stop early without losing anything.

## What each stage does

![Overview of the demo pipeline stages.](../static/harness-diagram.png)

**Build.** The target's `Dockerfile` is built into an ASAN-instrumented image
the first time you run a scan against it. The same image is reused for find, grade,
and re-attack, so every agent sees the same code in the same environment.

**Recon** (optional). An agent reads the source tree and proposes a partition
of the attack surface (*"here are 8 distinct parsers worth attacking
separately"*). This gives parallel runs different starting places so they
don't all converge on the same bug. `--auto-focus` runs this as a part of
the full pipeline. You can skip recon if you've hand-written `focus_areas:`
in the target's `config.yaml`.

**Find.** The core part of the loop. Each run gets one agent in its own 
network-isolated container. The agent reads the source, crafts malformed inputs, 
and runs the ASAN binary until an input crashes 3 out of 3 times. It outputs
the crashing input file (not a written report). Parallel find agents share a 
`found_bugs.jsonl` log and must justify why their addition is not a duplicate 
of something already listed before adding to it.

**Grade.** A second agent in a fresh container re-runs the PoC and checks that the 
crash is real (i.e., it reproduces, it's in project code, and it isn't just memory 
exhaustion). The only thing that crosses from the find container to the grader is 
the PoC bytes, so the grader isn't influenced by the find agent's reasoning. 
Flaky-but-real crashes (races, heap-layout-dependent) can pass this step, though
they will receive a lower score. Each run's verdict is written to `run_NNN/result.json` 
as soon as the grader agent finishes.

**Judge.** When a finding passes the grader, a short no-tools agent compares 
the crash against the bugs already in `reports/manifest.jsonl` and decides 
whether the finding is a new bug (in which case it's accepted), a cleaner example 
of a known bug (in which case it replaces the old version), or a duplicate (in 
which case it's skipped). Judge agents run serially so that two duplicate findings 
arriving around the same time aren't accidentally both classified as new. The
judge stage is only run when the `--stream` modifier is used.

**Report.** For each new bug, a report agent writes a structured exploitability 
analysis using only the PoC and the source. The report includes details on what 
the corrupted memory lets an attacker do, how reachable it is from real input, a 
sketch of the escalation path, and a severity. A separate grader agent then scores
the report, checking that its claims are backed by evidence (e.g., line numbers,
observed re-runs) rather than plausible prose. Reports land in `reports/bug_NN/report.json` 
and include the grader's score so you can tell which reports are most trustworthy.
The `--novelty` modifier (off by default) adds an upstream fix-status check: the
orchestrator host clones the target's `github_url` and injects the upstream
`git log` for the crashing file into the report prompt, so the report can state
whether the bug is already fixed upstream (FIXED/UNFIXED). Only the orchestrator
touches GitHub — the report container's egress stays restricted to the model
API — and the flag is off by default so air-gapped or outbound-restricted
environments never reach out.

**Dedup.** A separate command that can be run post-hoc to cluster the pipeline
results by ASAN signature. It's useful for a quick summary of "these N crashes
cluster into M signatures".

**Patch.** A separate command that generates a candidate patch for each unique
bug. For details, see [patching.md](patching.md).

## Watching a run

Transcripts and results are written to disk the moment they're produced,
so you can watch a run without stopping it:

- Each find and grade agent's transcript lands under `results/<target>/<ts>/run_NNN/`
  as the agent works. Transcripts persist on failed or killed runs.
- `found_bugs.jsonl` lists every crash submitted so far.
- Each run's `result.json` is written as soon as the grader finishes reviewing
  it, so counting `run_*/result.json` files tells you how many runs are finished.
- Filtering a transcript for `"type":"tool_use"` shows each command the agent ran.
  This is the quickest way to see what it's actually doing when you're iterating
  on prompts.
- With `--stream`, the `reports/` directory also fills in during the run. Judge
  and report transcripts are saved there, and `ls reports/bug_*/report.json` shows
  the reports written so far.

```

`--model` falls back to the `VULN_PIPELINE_MODEL` env var on every
agent-spawning subcommand (`run`, `recon`, `report`, `patch` — `dedup`
spawns no agents and takes no `--model`). The agent-spawning subcommands
also accept `--dangerously-no-sandbox`, which spawns agents under plain
`runc` with no syscall isolation — development on a throwaway VM only (see
[security.md](security.md)).

**A killed batch is resumable.** A killed orchestrator leaves per-run
`result.json` files on disk. `run --runs N --resume <dir>` — with the same
`--runs N` the batch was launched with; the default `--runs 1` is rejected
against a multi-run layout — skips runs whose `result.json` reached a
terminal status and retries the ones marked `agent_failed`, `build_failed`,
or `error`; the batch's `found_bugs.jsonl` and `focus_areas.json` are
reused, not re-seeded. `report` skips `bug_NN/report.json` checkpoints
that were successfully submitted and redoes failed ones automatically;
`--fresh` redoes all of them, including the good ones. Recovery recipe:
[troubleshooting.md § Pipeline run died mid-batch](troubleshooting.md#pipeline-run-died-mid-batch).

## Design principles

In short, the essential steps of an effective vulnerability-finding pipeline:

1. Build the target.
2. Spin up N agents to search for vulnerabilities.
3. Grade the findings.

We've found it most effective to break this into modular steps, each of which
saves its progress durably, and over time we've added more steps like
de-duplication, report writing, and so on. A Docker container image is a
great way to store a reusable build artifact and provides an environment in
which exploits can be attempted safely. Vulnerability-finding agents should
store their results in a standard format which can be verified by graders.
These agents can decide their own exploration path from the beginning, or you
can seed them with "focus areas" via a recon step. Graders should be able to
run over any findings multiple times as they're calibrated with human
feedback.

Aside from modularity, a critical component is an effective grader. The
grader must run as a separate agent with access to a clean sandbox in which
it can run any proofs of concept. It should be framed as an adversary
actively trying to disprove findings, which are guilty until proven innocent.
Proof-of-concept exploits that produce a witness are best, but not always
possible. The grader should also be tailored for the vulnerability types
under inspection: some bugs are proven by PoC, others by logical argument.
Tracks or a lightweight routing layer to different verifiers may be good
approaches when multiple classes are in scope.

## Rate limits and batch sizing

Plan on roughly **~10K uncached input tokens/min and ~2K output tokens/min
per running agent**. The rate varies a lot: time the agents spend compiling
and running the target throttles token consumption naturally. As a sizing
rule of thumb, keep concurrent agents to **~100 per 1M
input-tokens-per-minute** of rate-limit headroom — check your account's
limit in the [Haijun Console](https://platform.haijun.my.id/settings/limits);
same guidance as [troubleshooting.md § Rate limits](troubleshooting.md#rate-limits).
The small first wave in
[§ Install and first run](#install-and-first-run) is there so you can
measure your target's actual burn rate before scaling up.

Briefly bursting past your limit is not catastrophic: rate-limit errors are
absorbed by the retry-and-resume machinery described below, so you can run
near your provisioned capacity and let backoff absorb the bursts.

## Resume-on-error

Hitting a rate limit or other error mid-run does not lose work. Each agent 
is one long-lived `haijun -p` session. A 429 or 5xx is first retried with
backoff inside the Haijun CLI itself. If those retries exhaust, the pipeline
runs its own retry loop with backoff. These retries relaunch the agent with
the Haijun CLI's `--resume <session_id>`, which restores the full conversation 
so the agent can continue from the failed turn. This repeats up to 20 times.
If the retries exhaust after the agent already submitted a crash, the
submission is salvaged and graded; otherwise the run is marked
`agent_failed`, which a batch-level
`bin/vp-sandboxed run <target> --runs N --resume <results-dir>` retries.

The one exception is `error_max_turns`: exhausting the turn budget is
terminal by design — resuming would multiply the cap. A crash submitted
before the cap is still salvaged and graded; only the un-submitted
remainder of the run is lost. Raise `--max-turns` and re-run for a fresh
attempt.

We recommend carrying over similar logic if you build your own pipeline.

## Usage marker

Outbound API requests from pipeline agents carry a declared usage marker so
runbook usage is attributable in Juglow's request telemetry: an
`Juglow-cyber-runbook: pipeline` header plus a `cyber-runbook/<version>` leading
token in the User-Agent (the pinned `haijun-cli` version stays in the
parenthetical). Interactive track sessions in this repo set only the header —
`Juglow-cyber-runbook: tracks`, via `.haijun/settings.json` — and leave the
User-Agent untouched.

The marker is structural metadata only: static strings, no request content,
no identifiers beyond what the API request already carries. Pipeline agents
apply it only when authenticating directly to the Juglow API (API key or
OAuth) — on Bedrock/Vertex the provider rewrites the User-Agent and does not
forward custom headers to Juglow, so pipeline agents send no marker there.
The interactive-session header is provider-agnostic; on Bedrock it is
SigV4-signed like any other header and stays between you and AWS. It is
telemetry, not enforcement — to remove it, set `VULN_PIPELINE_NO_TELEMETRY=1`
(pipeline) or override `JUGLOW_CUSTOM_HEADERS` in your gitignored
`.haijun/settings.local.json` (tracks). An ambient `JUGLOW_CUSTOM_HEADERS`
in the operator's environment is deliberately not forwarded to the agents —
a Haijun Code session in this repo injects the `tracks` value into that
variable, which would mislabel pipeline traffic.
