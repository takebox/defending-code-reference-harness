"""Allowlist CONNECT proxy for the agent sandbox.

Agent containers sit on the docker --internal vp-internal network with no
default route; this proxy is their only path out. Only CONNECT to allowlisted
host:port tuples is honoured, so the agent (and anything it spawns) can reach
the API and nothing else. Denied attempts are logged — useful signal if an
agent tries to phone home. The orchestrator stays on the trusted host.

Run as a sidecar container dual-homed on vp-internal and the default bridge.
