# patch

A Haijun Code track that turns verified security findings into candidate
fixes: ranks the queue, routes each finding to the right verification path,
and writes every diff as inert text for human review — it never applies a
patch to your repo. The last leg of the vulnerability cycle: consumes
`/triage` output (preferred) or any findings file the triage ingest
recognizes, and delegates vuln-pipeline results to the execution-verified
`vuln-pipeline patch` ladder. For how it fits the pipeline and how to
review what it produces, see [docs/patching.md](../../../docs/patching.md).

## Requirements

- Haijun Code CLI installed and authenticated
- A findings input: `TRIAGE.json` (preferred — already verified and
  ranked), `VULN-FINDINGS.json` (unverified; the track warns),
  `INCIDENTS.json` (untriaged D&R output; the track warns), or a
  vuln-pipeline `results/<target>/<ts>/` directory
- A read-only checkout of the target codebase (`--repo`, default cwd) —
  required for static mode
- For pipeline input only: the vuln-pipeline installed and sandboxed, since
  the track shells out to `vuln-pipeline patch`. The target's `config.yaml`
  needs a `build_command` (the in-container rebuild step after applying a
  diff) and optionally a `test_command` (the regression suite for the
  regress tier). All four shipped C/C++ targets have `build_command`;
  only canary sets `test_command` — on the others the regress tier is
  skipped.

## Usage

```
/patch results/<target>/<ts>/TRIAGE.json --repo ./my-service          # canonical: triaged findings
/patch results/<target>/<ts>/TRIAGE.json --repo ./my-service --top 5  # only the 5 highest-severity
/patch results/<target>/<ts>/ --model <model-id>                      # pipeline results → verification ladder
/patch findings.json --repo ./src --id f003                           # one finding by id
/patch results/<target>/<ts>/TRIAGE.json --repo ./src --fresh         # ignore checkpoint, start over
```

How the input routes: a pipeline results directory delegates to the
`vuln-pipeline patch` CLI, whose ladder rebuilds the target, replays the
PoC, runs the test suite, and re-attacks the patched binary (a D&R results
directory containing `INCIDENTS.json` routes static instead). Static
findings (no PoC to replay) get a fresh-context patch subagent per finding
— root-cause-first, variant hunt, minimal diff, regression test emitted as
part of the diff — plus a separate reviewer agent that sees only
`{file, line, category}` and the diff bytes, never the scanner's prose.
`--model` is passed through to `vuln-pipeline patch`; in static mode
subagents inherit the session model.

You can also drive the pipeline CLI directly — same ladder, no track in
between (it ships with the pipeline; no extra install):

```bash
# After a find run has produced results/<target>/<ts>/:
bin/vp-sandboxed patch results/<target>/<ts>/ --model <m>

# Or try it standalone on the pre-baked canary fixture (no find run needed):
bin/vp-sandboxed patch targets/canary/fixtures/results_sample --model <m>
```

Full flag reference (`--bug`, `--parallel`, `--no-reattack`, `--style`,
iteration and turn caps):
[docs/patching.md § CLI reference](../../../docs/patching.md#cli-reference).

## Output

- Static mode: `./PATCHES/bug_NN/patch.diff` (the candidate fix, never
  applied) and `./PATCHES/bug_NN/patch_result.json` (verdict and
  provenance) — relative to the directory the track runs in, not to the
  findings file.
- Execution-verified mode: the ladder writes the pipeline layout —
  `reports/bug_NN/{patch.diff, patch_result.json}` inside the results
  directory, with transcripts streaming to `patch_transcript_itN.jsonl`
  and `reattack_transcript_itN.jsonl` per iteration — and the track also
  mirrors each diff and verdict into `./PATCHES/bug_NN/`, so both modes
  land in the same place.
- `PATCHES.md` / `PATCHES.json` — run summary either way, one row per
  finding. The `verified` field in each `./PATCHES/bug_NN/patch_result.json`
  says which path produced the diff: `ladder_passed` / `ladder_failed`
  (executable oracle) vs `static_review_only` (agent review). The
  pipeline-written `reports/bug_NN/patch_result.json` records the
  grader's `verdict` instead — it has no `verified` field.

## What it does and doesn't do

- **Does:** rank and filter findings, read the target source, generate
  diffs, review each diff independently, delegate pipeline input to the
  execution-verified ladder, write summaries.
- **Does not:** apply a diff, write anywhere in `--repo`, run
  `git apply`/`patch`, or execute the target in static mode. There is no
  `--apply` flag by design: the capability isn't present, so it can't be
  prompt-injected into use. Applying the fix is your move, after the
  review pass described in
  [docs/patching.md#reviewing-generated-patches](../../../docs/patching.md#reviewing-generated-patches).
