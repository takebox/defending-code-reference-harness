# customize

A Haijun Code track that ports the vuln-pipeline to your stack: a new
language, vulnerability class, detection mechanism, or target shape. It
reads the pipeline source, interviews you about your target, presents a
migration plan, and executes the edits after you approve. For when to
reach for it and what porting involves, see
[docs/customizing.md](../../../docs/customizing.md).

## Requirements

- Haijun Code CLI installed and authenticated
- This repo checked out — the track edits the pipeline in place (the
  domain-specific parts of `harness/`: stage prompts, trace parser,
  artifact schemas)
- Docker + the sandbox set up (`scripts/setup_sandbox.sh`) for the
  validation run at the end

## Usage

Inside Haijun Code:

```
> /customize
```

The track runs in five steps: it reads the pipeline source, interviews you
(operating context and goal first, then technical follow-ups: detection
signal, PoC shape, grading criteria), presents a file-by-file plan, waits
for your explicit approval, then executes and validates.

Setup variants — including running the port outside Haijun Code — are
covered in [docs/customizing.md](../../../docs/customizing.md).

## Output

No run directory — the output is the port itself:

- A migration plan you approve before any edit (what changes, what stays,
  open questions)
- Edits to the domain-specific files: the stage prompts under
  `harness/prompts/`, the trace parser, artifact schemas, and the
  target Dockerfile template
- A canary target under `targets/<domain>-canary/` with planted bugs of
  the new class, plus a validation run confirming the ported pipeline
  finds and grades them
