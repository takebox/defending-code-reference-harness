# threat-model

A Haijun Code track that builds a threat model for a target codebase. Three
modes: **bootstrap** derives the threat model from the target itself (source
tree, git history, public advisories, an optional past-vulns file);
**interview** discovers the threat model by walking an application owner
through the four-question framework; **bootstrap-then-interview** chains the
two. All modes write `THREAT_MODEL.md` in a shared schema.

## Why a threat model

Vulnerability scanners find instances; a threat model is the map of where
instances are likely to be and which ones matter. Hand the pipeline a threat
model and it knows where to look. Hand triage a threat model and it knows
which findings to escalate. Use the output's focus areas to seed the
`vuln-pipeline` recon partition and to inform how you prioritize `/triage`
results.

## Model selection

The track has no `model:` frontmatter pin; it runs on whatever model your
session uses (or `--model` if you pass one). It is designed for
reasoning-capable Haijun models — use the same model you run the rest of the
pipeline with. If you want the track itself to request a model, add a
`model:` line to `TRACK.md` frontmatter. It overrides the session model
(however set, `/model` or `--model`) only for the turn the track is invoked
in — fine for `bootstrap`, but the multi-turn `interview` reverts to the
session model on your next reply, so to hold a model across an interview,
set it at the session level instead.

## Installation

Project-scoped (already done if you cloned this repo):

```bash
ls .haijun/tracks/threat-model/
```

User-scoped:

```bash
cp -r .haijun/tracks/threat-model ~/.haijun/tracks/
```

## Usage

### Bootstrap (derive from target, git history, advisories)

Use when no application owner is available. Point it at a checkout and,
optionally, a list of past vulnerabilities:

```
/threat-model bootstrap targets/drlibs
/threat-model bootstrap targets/drlibs --vulns targets/drlibs/vulns.txt
```

Without `--vulns` the track mines `git log`, `CHANGELOG`, and GitHub Security
Advisories itself; with it, it ingests your supplied list first.

The track spawns a parallel research swarm (docs reader, surface mapper, asset
finder, git-history miner, advisory fetcher, vuln-file parser), synthesizes
their returns into the system-context / assets / entry-points sections,
generalizes the collected vulns into threat classes, gap-fills with STRIDE for
surfaces the vuln history didn't cover, and writes
`targets/drlibs/THREAT_MODEL.md`. On small targets (<50 source files) it runs
the same briefs sequentially instead of spawning.

### Interview (discover via owner conversation)

Use when an application owner is in the session.

```
/threat-model interview targets/alsa
/threat-model interview targets/alsa --design-doc targets/alsa/README.md
```

Without `--design-doc` the interview opens cold by asking the owner to
describe the system; with it, the track reads the doc first and summarizes it
back for confirmation.

The track will walk the owner through the four questions ("what are we working
on?", "what can go wrong?", "what are we going to do about it?", "did we do a
good job?"), grounding answers in the code as it goes, and write
`targets/alsa/THREAT_MODEL.md`.

### Bootstrap then Interview (bootstrap a draft, then refine via interview)

Use when an owner is available but their time is limited: bootstrap produces
the draft unattended, then the interview spends owner time only on what the
code couldn't answer.

```
/threat-model bootstrap-then-interview targets/drlibs/
```

The interview will focus on the bootstrap's open questions instead of starting
cold. If the bootstrap already ran in an earlier session, seed the interview
with its output instead of re-running it:

```
/threat-model interview targets/drlibs/ --seed targets/drlibs/THREAT_MODEL.md
```

## Checkpointing and resume (bootstrap mode)

Bootstrap writes per-stage checkpoints to `./.threat-model-state/` in the
current working directory (cwd-confined by `checkpoint.py`). If a run is
interrupted, re-invoking `/threat-model bootstrap <target-dir>` from the same
working directory
resumes from the last completed stage — the research swarm is not re-spawned
if Stage 1 already landed. Pass `--fresh` to start over. The state directory
is scratch; add it to `.gitignore`.

## Output

`<target-dir>/THREAT_MODEL.md` with seven sections: system context, assets,
entry points & trust boundaries, threats (the table), deprioritized, open
questions, provenance. See `schema.md` for the full contract; a worked
example lives at `targets/drlibs/THREAT_MODEL.md`.

## Notes

- The track is read-only — it does not build, run, or probe the target —
  and is safe to point at any local checkout.
- The output is a starting point for human review, not a substitute for it.
