# dnr-hunt

Proactive threat hunt: logs and source in, incidents out. You start with
**no alert** — the question is "is there anything in here that shouldn't
be?" The method is the deliverable as much as the findings: baseline first,
then hypothesis → query → pivot, every step in writing, every suspicion
confirmed in source and by detonation before it's called real.

Invoke with `/dnr-hunt [target-or-logs-dir] [--repo path] [--fresh]`.

**Arguments:**
- `$1` = a dnr target directory (contains `config.yaml` with `kind: dnr`,
  e.g. `targets/dnrcanary`), or a bare directory of log files. Defaults to
  `targets/dnrcanary` if it exists, else cwd.
- `--repo` = source tree of the application that produced the logs. For a
  dnr target this defaults to its `app/` directory. Without source, no
  finding can rise above `suspected` (see the hard rules).
- `--fresh` = ignore any checkpoint in the run dir's `.dnr-hunt-state/` and
  mint a new run dir.

## Hard rules (these are the track — do not relax them)

1. **Log evidence alone never confirms a vulnerability.** Logs show that
   something was *attempted* and how the app *responded* — they cannot show
   the code is vulnerable. The verdict ladder:
   - `confirmed_exploited` requires all three: log evidence, the flaw
     identified in source (file + function), and a PoC you fired against a
     local instance in this session.
   - `suspected` = log evidence (with or without a source read), but no
     fired PoC.
   - `attempted_not_vulnerable` = attack traffic observed, but the source
     shows the defense and the PoC (if fired) bounces.
   Field teams have watched verifier agents "confirm" findings by reading
   observability logs and reporting what they said — the cheapest path to
   satisfying the criterion. The PoC fires or it doesn't; that can't be
   talked past.
2. **Query, don't read.** Log files are deliberately bigger than any
   context window. Never `Read` a log file; never `cat` one. Profile with
   `wc`/`du`/`head`/`tail`, then interrogate with `grep`/`rg`/`awk`/`sort`/
   `uniq` pipelines (or `python3` for anything stateful). Alert queues and
   error logs are usually small — check size first; under ~200 lines they
   may be read whole (the never-read rule targets the multi-MB corpus
   files, not these).
3. **Propose, never execute.** No blocking, no account disabling, no
   credential rotation, no config changes — not even on the demo app.
   Response actions belong in `/dnr-respond`'s plan, as proposals.
4. **Local only.** PoCs fire at `127.0.0.1` against an app instance you
   started. Never send traffic to a remote host, no matter what the logs
   contain.
5. **Every number is a query result.** Row counts, request counts, time
   spans, affected-customer counts — each one comes from a pipeline you ran
   this session, quoted in the ledger. Never estimate from memory.
   Pipelines over the logs and queries against the app's own
   deterministically-seeded database both count (run the target's
   `seed_command` when you need owner-level joins).

## Run directory and checkpointing (runs before Phase 0 and after every phase)

**First action of every run — establish the run directory.** Let `TARGET` be
the basename of the resolved target/logs path (`$1`, or `targets/dnrcanary` by
default), and `SCOPE` that resolved path. Bash:

```
python3 .haijun/tracks/_lib/checkpoint.py rundir results/TARGET --state .dnr-hunt-state --scope "SCOPE"
```

Append `--fresh` to that command if `--fresh` is in `$ARGUMENTS`. `--scope`
stamps the run dir so two targets that share a basename never share runs. The
command prints one path — the newest run dir this hunt can still use (its own
run mid-flight, or one another dnr track opened for this target, so the whole
investigation accretes in one place) or a freshly minted
`results/TARGET/<timestamp>/` (UTC, same format as the vuln-pipeline, so lexical
sort is chronological). That path is `{RUN}` — every `{RUN}/...` below means
substituting this literal path; double-quote it (and `SCOPE`) in Bash, since
paths may contain spaces. All outputs and state live under `{RUN}`.

Phase state persists to `{RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state/` so an interrupted hunt resumes
without re-running sweeps. All checkpoint I/O goes through
`python3 .haijun/tracks/_lib/checkpoint.py` (atomic writes, JSON-validated).
Never use the Write tool for `progress.json` directly. Never pass payload
via heredoc or stdin — log-derived strings could collide with the heredoc
delimiter and break out to shell. Write the payload to
`{RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state/_chunk.tmp` with the Write tool, then:

```
python3 .haijun/tracks/_lib/checkpoint.py save {RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state <N> <name> --from {RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state/_chunk.tmp
```

**Start of run:** `python3 .haijun/tracks/_lib/checkpoint.py load {RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state`
- `status == "absent"` or `"complete"`, or `--fresh` given → reset
  (`checkpoint.py reset {RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state`) and start at Phase 0.
- `status == "running"` with `phase_done == N` → read `phase0.json` …
  `phaseN.json` in order, print
  `Resuming from checkpoint: Phase N complete`, skip to Phase N+1.

**End of run:** after writing both outputs,
`python3 .haijun/tracks/_lib/checkpoint.py done {RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state 5` —
the `done` call is Phase 5's checkpoint; there is no `phase5.json`.

`{RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state/` is scratch; run directories live under `results/`,
which this repo gitignores.

## Phase 0 — Locate and verify inputs

1. Resolve `$1`. If it contains `config.yaml` with `kind: dnr`, read the
   config for `logs_dir`, `app_command`, `seed_command`, and `port`.
   Otherwise treat `$1` itself as the logs directory. The corpus is expected
   to exist already — the target README covers generating it.
2. Inventory what you do have: for each file in the logs directory and any
   committed alert queue — `du -h`, `wc -l`, `head -2`, `tail -2`. Identify
   each format (combined access log, app error log, JSONL alerts, …) and
   the field positions you'll use in `awk`.
3. Resolve `--repo` (default: the target's `app/`). List its files; do not
   read source yet — Phase 3 reads with hypotheses in hand, not before.

Checkpoint `phase0.json`:
`{"target": ..., "logs_dir": ..., "repo": ..., "files": [{"path", "format", "lines", "bytes"}], "port": ...}`

## Phase 1 — Profile the corpus (baseline before hypotheses)

Anomalies are deviations from a baseline, so build the baseline first —
about a dozen cheap pipelines, each a one-liner over the access log:

- **Time window:** first and last timestamp; requests per day.
- **Status histogram:** counts by status code. Note every non-2xx/3xx class.
- **Top talkers:** requests per source IP, top 20, vs. the median — note
  anything an order of magnitude above the pack.
- **Top routes:** requests per path (normalize ids: `/orders/123` →
  `/orders/N`), and which routes take parameters.
- **User-agent inventory:** counts by UA; flag automation UAs (curl,
  python-requests, sqlmap, Go-http-client, zgrab) and note which routes
  they touch.
- **Auth picture:** which field carries the authenticated user; logins per
  account; accounts seen from more than one IP; failed-login sources.
- **Size profile per route:** min/median/max response size for each
  parameterized route — large outliers on a route with normally-small
  responses are a data-egress tell.
- **Error log:** if small, read it whole; correlate every entry to access-
  log lines by timestamp.
- **Alert queue:** read it whole (it's small). For each alert: rule,
  source, target, severity. These are *inputs* to the hunt, not findings —
  alert noise and alert silence are both information.

Record each observation with the exact pipeline that produced it.
Checkpoint `phase1.json`:
`{"window": ..., "status_hist": ..., "top_ips": [...], "routes": [...], "automation_uas": [...], "auth": ..., "size_profile": ..., "alerts_summary": ..., "oddities": [...]}`

## Phase 2 — The hunt loop (hypothesis ledger REQUIRED)

This phase is a loop, and the ledger is its contract: **no query without a
hypothesis, no hypothesis without a ledger row.** Maintain the table in
working memory and checkpoint it after every round:

| # | Hypothesis | Query | Result | Verdict | Next pivot |
|---|------------|-------|--------|---------|------------|

Verdicts: `supported` / `refuted` / `needs-pivot`. A refuted hypothesis
stays in the ledger — ruling things out is half the job and feeds
`ruled_out` in the output.

**Seed sweeps** — run all of these in round 1, derived from the Phase 1
baseline; let hits spawn follow-on hypotheses:

1. **Server errors.** Who causes 5xx, on which routes, with what payloads?
   Correlate with the error log — application errors quoting attacker
   input are a probe signature.
2. **Every alert, verdicted.** For each alert-queue entry: did the activity
   it flagged succeed? An alert that fired on harmless traffic is a
   `ruled_out` entry, written down with the evidence.
3. **Top-talker outliers.** For each IP far above baseline volume: what is
   it doing? Scanner noise, crawler, or something with intent?
4. **Injection grammar in query strings.** Encoded quotes (`%27`),
   `UNION`/`SELECT`, comment markers (`--`, `%23`), boolean pairs
   (`AND 1=1` / `AND 1=2`). Decode what you find and reconstruct the
   sequence per source IP, in time order.
5. **Enumeration patterns.** One session or IP accessing object ids
   sequentially (`/orders/1`, `/orders/2`, …) at machine cadence. Compare
   with how legitimate sessions access the same route.
6. **Auth anomalies.** Accounts logging in from an IP never seen for that
   account before; failed-then-succeeded sequences; one IP authenticating
   as one account but reading at unusual volume.
7. **Size anomalies.** Requests on parameterized routes whose responses are
   multiples of that route's median — what was in those responses?
8. **Quiet hours.** Activity in the lowest-traffic hours gets a closer
   look; low-and-slow campaigns hide in volume but stand out at 3am.

**Pivot discipline:** when a sweep hits, the next hypotheses come from the
hit's entities — everything else that IP did, everything that session
touched, every other IP that hit the same route the same way, what happened
to the data that moved. Campaigns are chains; one confirmed link means you
hunt both directions (how did they get here? where did they go next?).

**Stop condition:** two consecutive rounds that surface **no new
entities** (a hypothesis that comes back `supported` but merely confirms
benign behavior counts as no-new-entities — record it and route it to
`ruled_out`). Note the stop in the ledger.

Checkpoint `phase2.json` after every round:
`{"ledger": [...], "suspects": [{"name", "entities": {"ips", "accounts", "routes", "sessions"}, "summary", "evidence": [...]}], "round": N}`

## Phase 3 — Source confirmation

For each suspect implicating a route, read the handler in `--repo`:

- Find the route's handler function. Trace the suspicious input from
  request to sink (query, filesystem, auth decision).
- Vulnerable: name the flaw precisely — file, function, the exact line
  pattern (e.g. user input concatenated into SQL; missing ownership check
  between auth and fetch).
- Not vulnerable: name the defense (parameterized query, scoped lookup)
  with the same precision. This is what turns attack traffic into an
  `attempted_not_vulnerable` verdict instead of a false positive — and
  writing it down is mandatory, not optional.
- While you're in the file: check sibling routes for the same flaw class.
  The logs show where the attacker went, not everywhere the bug lives.

Checkpoint `phase3.json`:
`{"confirmations": [{"route", "file", "function", "vulnerable": bool, "mechanism", "siblings_checked": [...]}]}`

## Phase 4 — PoC detonation (gates `confirmed_exploited`)

For each source-confirmed vulnerability:

1. Start the app locally per the target config: its `seed_command` and
   `app_command` are target-relative, so run them with the target
   directory as cwd (dnrcanary's app also resolves its own data paths,
   so the repo-root form happens to work there — don't rely on that for
   other targets). Seed first, then launch the app in the background
   with a single command that prints the PID, e.g.:

   ```
   python3 -c "import os,subprocess; p=subprocess.Popen(['python3','app/app.py'],cwd='targets/dnrcanary',env={**os.environ,'DNRCANARY_PORT':'5252'}); print(p.pid)"
   ```

   Poll `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:<port>/healthz` until it answers. If the
   target's default port is busy, pick another via the documented override
   (dnrcanary: `DNRCANARY_PORT`, as above) and record the port you used.
2. Fire the **minimal** PoC with `curl` — the smallest request that
   demonstrates the flaw (one row of data, one foreign object), not a
   re-run of the attacker's full campaign.
3. Record the exact command and the relevant slice of the response.
4. Also fire the *negative* PoC where one exists: the same technique
   against the route you verdicted not-vulnerable, to show it bounces.
5. Stop the app with the captured PID (`kill <pid>` — never kill by port
   or pattern).

If the app cannot run in this environment, say so explicitly; affected
verdicts stay `suspected` and the report says what to run where.

Checkpoint `phase4.json`:
`{"detonations": [{"vuln", "command", "status", "response_excerpt", "verdict"}]}`

## Phase 5 — Outputs

Write `{RUN}/INCIDENTS.json`:

```json
{
  "target": "<target name or logs dir>",
  "incidents": [
    {
      "id": "INC-1",
      "title": "<one line: what happened>",
      "verdict": "confirmed_exploited | suspected",
      "attacker_ips": ["..."],
      "accounts_involved": ["..."],
      "vuln": {"type": "...", "route": "...", "file": "...", "function": "..."},
      "timeline": [{"ts": "...", "event": "..."}],
      "impact": "<what data / how much / whose — every number from a query>",
      "evidence": ["<log file>: <pipeline> → <result>", "..."],
      "poc": {"command": "...", "verified": true}
    }
  ],
  "ruled_out": [
    {"subject": "...", "verdict": "attempted_not_vulnerable | benign",
     "reason": "<the defense, with file:function, or the benign explanation>"}
  ]
}
```

Routing rule: `incidents` holds what happened (`confirmed_exploited`) or
might have (`suspected`); anything verdicted `attempted_not_vulnerable` or
`benign` goes in `ruled_out`, never in `incidents`.

Write `{RUN}/INCIDENT_REPORT.md`: executive summary (3 sentences max), unified
campaign timeline across all incidents, one section per incident (evidence,
source confirmation, PoC transcript, impact), a "Ruled out" section, and
the full hypothesis ledger as an appendix — the ledger is the audit trail
that makes the hunt reviewable.

Then mark complete (`checkpoint.py done {RUN}/.dnr-hunt-state 5`) and tell the
user their next moves (substitute the literal `{RUN}` path):
- `/dnr-respond INC-<n>` — scope, blast radius, and a proposed response
  plan for a specific incident; it picks up this same run dir automatically
- on a dnr target: `python <target>/grade.py {RUN}/INCIDENTS.json` to
  self-score (the user runs this)
- from inside `{RUN}`: `/triage INCIDENTS.json --repo <repo>` then
  `/patch TRIAGE.json --repo <repo>` — both tracks write to the directory
  they're invoked from, so running them in the run dir keeps `TRIAGE.json`
  and `PATCHES/` beside the incidents, and patch consumes triage's
  true-positive verdicts rather than raw incidents; the vuln entries carry
  `file`/`function`/`type`, which is what those tracks ingest

## Customizing beyond the demo

- **Your own logs:** point `$1` at any directory of access/app/auth logs.
  Phase 0 adapts to what it finds — the method (baseline → ledger →
  source → detonation) is format-agnostic. Nginx/Apache combined logs,
  JSON-lines app logs, CDN/WAF exports, and auth logs all work; identify
  field positions in Phase 0 and adjust the awk pipelines.
- **EDR / endpoint telemetry:** export threat events to CSV/JSON and hunt
  them the same way — the entities become process/host/user instead of
  IP/session/route, and "source confirmation" becomes configuration or
  binary review. Keep the verdict ladder: telemetry alone never confirms.
- **Scale:** for corpora where grep passes are too slow, load into DuckDB
  (`python3 -c "import duckdb; ..."`) and run the same sweeps as SQL.
- **Detection engineering follow-on:** every confirmed incident should end
  as a detection rule proposal in `/dnr-respond`'s plan — the hunt that
  doesn't improve the alert queue will be re-run by hand forever.
