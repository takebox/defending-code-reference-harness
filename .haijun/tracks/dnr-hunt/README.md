# dnr-hunt

A Haijun Code track for proactive threat hunting over web/application logs:
profiles the corpus, runs a hypothesis-driven hunt loop with a written
ledger, confirms suspects in source, fires a local PoC, and writes
`INCIDENTS.json` + `INCIDENT_REPORT.md`. The no-alert entry to the
detection & response track — pairs with `/dnr-respond` (lead-in-hand
workup) and feeds `/triage` → `/patch`; demo target: `targets/dnrcanary`.
For how the track fits together, see
[docs/detection-response.md](../../../docs/detection-response.md).

## Requirements

- Haijun Code CLI installed and authenticated
- A directory of logs. For the demo target they must be **generated
  first** (~82 MB, gitignored, byte-deterministic per seed on the same machine):

  ```bash
  pip install flask pyyaml               # flask runs the app; pyyaml runs the grader
  python3 targets/dnrcanary/generate_logs.py --seed 42
  ```

  The scenario briefing is in
  [`targets/dnrcanary/README.md`](../../../targets/dnrcanary/README.md).
- Optionally the application source (`--repo`) — without it, findings
  cannot rise above `suspected`

## Usage

```
/dnr-hunt                                  # defaults to targets/dnrcanary
/dnr-hunt targets/dnrcanary                # explicit dnr target
/dnr-hunt /var/log/myapp --repo ~/src/app  # your own logs + source
/dnr-hunt targets/dnrcanary --fresh        # ignore checkpoint, restart
```

## Output

Outputs land in a per-run directory, `results/<target>/<timestamp>/` — the
same layout the other runbook tracks use, so a new hunt never clobbers a
previous one. `/dnr-respond` adopts the run dir automatically; `/triage` and
`/patch` write to the directory they're invoked from, so run them from
inside the run dir to keep their outputs beside the incidents.

- `<run>/INCIDENTS.json` — incidents with verdicts (`confirmed_exploited` /
  `suspected`), attacker entities, timeline, quantified impact, evidence
  pipelines, and PoC; plus `ruled_out` for everything verdicted
  `attempted_not_vulnerable` or `benign`.
- `<run>/INCIDENT_REPORT.md` — executive summary, campaign timeline, evidence
  per incident, and the full hypothesis ledger as the audit trail.

Example output: [`targets/dnrcanary/example_track_runs/`](../../../targets/dnrcanary/example_track_runs/)

On the demo target, score the result yourself afterwards:
`python3 targets/dnrcanary/grade.py <run>/INCIDENTS.json`. The target README
marks its answer-key files (ground truth, grader, log-generator source) as
spoilers — keep them out of the hunt; grading is your move after the
write-up. The autonomous harness enforces this structurally by excluding
those files from the hunt container.

## What it does and doesn't do

- **Does:** query logs (grep/awk/DuckDB), maintain a hypothesis ledger,
  read source, start the demo app on 127.0.0.1 and fire minimal PoCs at it.
- **Does not:** confirm anything from logs alone; execute response actions;
  send traffic to remote hosts. Blocking, rotation, and the like appear
  only as `/dnr-respond` *proposals*.

Installation and support are the same for all tracks in this repo: see
the [repo README](../../../README.md). Both DNR tracks checkpoint their
phase state under the run directory, so an interrupted session resumes
where it left off.
