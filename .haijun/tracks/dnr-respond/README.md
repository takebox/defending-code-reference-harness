# dnr-respond

A Haijun Code track for lead-in-hand incident response: takes an alert, an
IOC, or a `/dnr-hunt` finding; scopes it across the logs; verdicts whether
the attack succeeded; quantifies blast radius; confirms root cause in
source with a local PoC; and writes a **proposed, never executed**
containment/remediation/recovery plan. The lead-in-hand entry to the
detection & response track — pairs with `/dnr-hunt` (no-alert hunting) and
feeds `/triage` → `/patch`; demo target: `targets/dnrcanary`. For how the
track fits together, see
[docs/detection-response.md](../../../docs/detection-response.md).

## Requirements

- Haijun Code CLI installed and authenticated
- A directory of logs. For the demo target they must be **generated
  first** (~82 MB, gitignored, byte-deterministic per seed on the same machine):

  ```bash
  pip install flask pyyaml               # flask runs the app; pyyaml runs the grader
  python3 targets/dnrcanary/generate_logs.py --seed 42
  ```

  The scenario briefing is in
  [`targets/dnrcanary/README.md`](../../../targets/dnrcanary/README.md).
- A lead: an incident id, an alert line, an IOC, or a sentence
- Optionally the application source (`--repo`)

## Usage

```
/dnr-respond INC-2                                      # /dnr-hunt handoff
/dnr-respond '{"rule":"SQLI-FORM-001","src_ip":"203.0.113.66",...}'
/dnr-respond 203.0.113.66 --logs targets/dnrcanary
/dnr-respond "customer says their address showed up in a phishing email"
```

## Output

Outputs land in the run directory for the target, `results/<target>/<timestamp>/`
— the same one `/dnr-hunt` wrote (this track adopts it), so the response sits
beside the hunt that produced the lead. If there was no prior hunt, a fresh
run dir is minted.

- `<run>/RESPONSE.md` — verdict & summary, merged timeline, then proposed
  containment, eradication & remediation, recovery, detection-engineering
  rules, and open questions. Every action carries what / why /
  risk-if-wrong. **Nothing in it has been executed.** Per-lead files like
  `RESPONSE-INC-2.md` are written when more than one lead is worked in the
  same run.
- `<run>/INCIDENTS.json` — created or updated with the worked incident.
  Same schema as `/dnr-hunt`; vuln entries are `/triage`-compatible.

Example output: [`targets/dnrcanary/example_track_runs/RESPONSE-INC-1.md`](../../../targets/dnrcanary/example_track_runs/RESPONSE-INC-1.md)

## What it does and doesn't do

- **Does:** entity-scope a lead across logs, quantify impact with queries,
  read source, fire minimal PoCs at a locally-started app, draft the
  response plan.
- **Does not:** execute any response action; confirm anything from logs
  alone; send traffic to remote hosts.

Installation and support are the same for all tracks in this repo: see
the [repo README](../../../README.md). Both DNR tracks checkpoint their
phase state under the run directory, so an interrupted session resumes
where it left off.
