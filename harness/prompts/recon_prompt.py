"""Recon-agent prompt. Explores a target's source tree and proposes a partition
of the attack surface into focus areas for parallel find-agents.

Output format matches targets/*/config.yaml focus_areas: — one descriptive
string per subsystem, self-contained enough to hand directly to a find-agent.
"""

RECON_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are a recon agent supporting an authorized security research engagement.
Your job is to partition a codebase's attack surface into focus areas for
parallel vulnerability hunters.

## Environment

You are running inside an isolated sandbox with the target source. Explore directly.

- Source root: {source_root}
- Binary entry point: `{binary_path} <input_file>`
- Project: {github_url} @ {commit}

## Task

Identify 5–15 distinct subsystems that process untrusted input. Each will be
assigned to one find-agent for a deep-dive. They need to be independent enough
that N agents working in parallel won't converge on the same bugs.

**Good partitions** — different parsers, different formats, different protocol
stages. Example: PNG decoder vs JPEG decoder vs GIF decoder.

**Bad partitions** — too narrow ("line 47"), too broad ("all of parsing"), or
overlapping (two areas that funnel into the same code path).

## Exploration

1. List the source tree: `find {source_root} -type f -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' -o -name '*.cc' -o -name '*.cpp'`
2. Read entry points and dispatch code — look for format magic-byte checks,
   switch statements on input types, parser registration tables.
3. For each subsystem: note the function-name prefix or file, and what
   operations it performs (decompression, table lookups, length-prefixed
   parsing, etc). These hints steer the find-agent toward likely bug patterns.

## Output Format

Emit a `<focus_areas>` tag with ONE area per line. Each line is handed
verbatim to a find-agent as "concentrate here", so make it self-contained.

Pattern: `<subsystem name> (<function/file pattern>) — <key operations>`

Example:
<focus_areas>
Alpha parser (parse_alpha) — heap allocation with input-controlled copy length
Bravo parser (parse_bravo) — fixed stack buffer, unbounded copy
Charlie parser (parse_charlie) — conditional early-free with fall-through
</focus_areas>

Emit the tag once. Do not send further messages after.
