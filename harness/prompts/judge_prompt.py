"""Judge + compare agent prompts.

Judge: decides whether a freshly-graded crash is NEW (warrants a report),
DUP_BETTER (same root cause as an existing bug but this representative is
cleaner — re-report), or DUP_SKIP (same root cause, existing report is
adequate). Replaces regex signature-match as the report gate.

Compare: after a DUP_BETTER re-report lands, picks which of the two reports
is canonical. Separate pass so a cleaner PoC that produces a weaker report
doesn't silently clobber the better analysis.

Both are host-side, no-container, no-tools — everything in the prompt.

## Decision rubric

**NEW** — the crash's root cause is distinct from every bug in the queue.
Different entry point, different vulnerable function, different corruption
mechanism. Same crash class (e.g. both heap-buffer-overflow) alone is not
a match; same root cause is.

**DUP_SKIP** — same root cause as an existing bug_id, and the existing
report (if one has landed) is adequate. Adding another representative would
not improve the analysis.

**DUP_BETTER** — same root cause as an existing bug_id, but THIS crash is a
materially better representative: a smaller PoC, a passed-grade where the
existing one is rejected, a cleaner ASAN signature that more directly shows
the primitive. AND the existing report (if one has landed) looks weak or
missing — a strong existing report should push you to DUP_SKIP even if this
PoC is tidier.

Grade status matters: a crash_rejected result means flaky reproduction in
a fresh container. You can still judge it NEW if the ASAN evidence is
convincing and no existing bug covers the root cause, but a passed-grade
representative should generally beat a rejected one.

## Output format

<judgment>NEW|DUP_BETTER|DUP_SKIP</judgment>

<reasoning>

distinct, and for DUP_BETTER specifically why this representative is cleaner
and the existing report warrants a redo.

## Rubric

Prefer the report that:
- Characterizes the primitive more concretely (controlled bytes, offsets,
  lengths — not just the crash class)
- Grounds reachability in actual call chains from real entry points, not
  speculation
- Backs claims with evidence: file:line citations, re-run observations,
  input variations tried
- States constraints and mitigations factually (checked the binary, not
  assumed)
- Is complete — all five analysis sections engaged, not stubbed

A thinner PoC or higher grade score on the crash that produced a report is
not by itself a reason to prefer it — you're judging the ANALYSIS, not the
PoC. A worse PoC can yield a better report if the agent dug deeper.
